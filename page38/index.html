Interesting article over at the BBC where Ross Anderson (author of the excellent "Security Engineering") is questioning the security of the new (in the UK) Chip and PIN rollout.<br />
He makes an interesting point, which is that if crooks can create fake readers they can set up business and use them to gather credit card details...<br />
Now I'd like to think that this shouldn't be possible (or at least easy), I'd have expected something like a mutual authentication between card and reader or something like that to mitigate this kind of attack, however the quote on the story from the representitive of the Chip and PIN companies doesn't make me feel too comfortable<br />
<em><br />
"We don't think they can use fake machines because the machines themselves are engineered to read the chip so they must be reading the chip very carefully.  That makes the transaction itself extremely secure."</em><br />
Now that kind of implies to me that they're relying on the difficulty of creating a reader to protect the card details, I really hope there's more to it than that, because we've been shown that that kind of protection doesn't last...</p>

Well if anyone needed another reason to avoid using Internet Explorer, I think that this vulnerability provides it.<br />
If you have a look at the demonstration at <a href="http://secunia.com/internet_explorer_cross-site_scripting_vulnerability_test/"> secunia</a> you get a very scary (if you're responsible for the security of an e-commerce site) demonstration.<br />
As far as I can remember, this is the first vulnerability I've seen where the SSL padlock is useless as an indicator of what site you're on, with the closest phishers have got in the past being graphical representations of the toolbar which were far from flawless.<br />
The reason this is scary, is that if you look at the advice given by many banks and e-commerce sites, checking the SSL certificate via the padlock plays a major part in confirming you're on the right site, so now if a customer gets caught by this there's almost nothing they can do to tell they're on a fake site...<br />

    <p>Over at <a title="Schneier on Security: Desktop Google Finds Holes" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/desktop_google.html">Schneier on Security</a>, there's a refreshingly sensible piece on Google's desktop search.<br />
As Bruce points out, all that information that people are getting so worried about being found by the tool is ALREADY THERE, so if there's a shared PC and you're worried about people seeing the data of other users... Don't give them the rights to see those areas!!<br />
If you're worried that users using Internet Cafe's will expose corporate data by it being indexed when it's put on the Internet Cafe PC, set your policy and technical controls so that you're users don't put corporate data on untrusted machines!!<br />
Sorry, but the flow of "Google desktop is evil" stories made me cranky...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/11/29/is_microsoft_cr/">Interesting opinion piece on Internet Explorer security</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a title="Is Microsoft creating tomorrow's IE security holes today? | The Register" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/29/ie_security_holes/">Is Microsoft creating tomorrow's IE security holes today? | The Register</a><br />
Quite an interesting piece, wondering whether Microsoft is creating problems for itself in the future with IE, with amongst other things, tight integration with the OS.<br />
I do disagree with one or two point made though, especially "<em>Rapid development cycles won the browser wars, and it wasn't the strong-arming or the marketing that motivated users to switch browsers, it was the features</em>"<br />
My memory of it was that IE wasn't <em>that</em> much more featureful than Netscape Navigator, and if you want to know my opinion of why Microsoft won that war it is the plain and simple fact of being bundled on the desktop when Navigator wasn't.  Non-technical users do not go looking for alternate products, so long as the default one they're provided with does a reasonable job.<br />
In fact it's telling that Firefox is gaining ground on IE, as that says to me that a percentage of Internet users no longer regard IE as doing a reasonable job.<br />
Back to the story, I'd agree that tight OS integration is to my mind a problem for IE.  I see no reason why an Operating system <strong>has</strong> to have an Internet Browser.  Definately for server operating systems it seems totally redundant (although in several use cases I add that a GUI on a server is a waste of resouces).<br />
From a security point of view having components so tightly integrated into the OS that an administrator cannot easily remove (not disable) them just increases the amount of code that needs maintained and increases the likelihood that code on the server will have an exploitable security vulnerability....</p>

While I'm not sure if this is the "major UK Site" referred to in the previous posting, there's some information about a compromise of one of the registers advert suppliers in the story above..<br />
It's really quite a cunning plan by whoever carried it out, as they've realised that you only need to compromise one set of servers (the advertising company) in order to potentially infect many of their clients.....<br />
One thought that occurs to me from this is that you have to wonder whether sites should be taking steps to validate adverts and any other 3rd party content which is provided by frames on their site..... (heck imagine if someone managed to compromise the servers which provide those advertising boxes provided by search engine companies!!!)</p>
