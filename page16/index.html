This time HSBC have lost 370,000 sets of personal details from insurance customers.  One thing that puzzles me in the reporting of this story is the statement that<br />
<b><i>although the data on the disc was protected by a password it had not been encrypted</i></b><br />
How do you password protect something without encrypting it ?!  Any software I'm aware of that does password protection will at very least use some form of rudimentary encryption (eg, old versions of winzip or office) or in most cases (pgp, modern office/winzip versions) perfectly acceptable levels of encryption for most scenarios...</p>

<p>Interesting to see someone have a shot a putting numbers on how far Oracle are behind Microsoft in the database security arena (well secure features as opposed to security features anyway).  The number that they come up with is 5 years...<br />
Assuming that nothing turns up soon it actually looks like SQL Server 2005 will go through it's whole product lifecycle without a published vulnerability.  <a href="http://secunia.com/product/6782/">Secunia</a> are currently showing it affected by 0 vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2008/03/08/february_owasp/">February OWASP meeting</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The February meeting of the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland">scottish OWASP chapter</a> went pretty well on the 28th.<br />
We had Steve Moyle doing a presentation on Database security (slides can be found <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-scotland/attachments/20080306/626374c3/attachment-0001.ppt"> here</a> )<br />
I picked up some interesting ideas from his presentation.  Firstly the idea that relational databases have a fundamental flaw when it comes to security, which is that the channel used to control them and the channel used to access the information they contain, are the same.  This allows for someone who should only have access to information in the system to easily attack it as well.<br />
The other thought which occurred to me when I was listening to the presentation was that any IDS/IPS style device which wants to block "malicious" traffic going to a system needs to parse the information it's seeing <i> in the same way as the protected system </i> otherwise there's a risk that quirks of rendering will introduce false positives or negatives.<br />
It's something I was talking to a WAF vendor about recently, as I was asking them whether their product rendered JavaScript when looking for malicious traffic, as there's a specific problem with the idea of self-modifying JavaScript, looking innocuous in transit but then being malicious when executed</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's a couple of good security events coming up in Scotland which should be a great chance to meet some of the security community up here and also hear some good speakers!<br />
On the 28th of February, there's an OWASP Scotland meeting with Dr Steven Moyle of <a href="http://www.secerno.com/">Secerno</a> doing a talk on Database Security.  There's more information and the address to RSVP to on the <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-scotland/2008-February/000010.html">OWASP Scotland Mailing list</a><br />
Next up on the 27th of March is the latest <a href="http://www.securetest.com/">Securetest Edinburgh RANT</a> with Graeme Marsh from <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/home/0,1044,stc%253DHOME%2526lid%253D7,00.html?WT.mc_id=UKGoogle_NatAd">Deloittes</a> doing a talk on "Plugging the Gap - Information Leakage in Organisations".  For more information and to RSVP for this one go to <a href="http://www.securetest.com/events/view-event.aspx?id=209"> this page</a> on SecureTests site.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2008/02/01/interesting_new/">Interesting new site?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's a post over at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hackers/archive/2008/01/31/hellosecureworld-com-launched.aspx"> Microsoft %41%43%45%20%54%65%61%6d blog</a> about their new Hello secure world resource.<br />
When I saw this I thought I'd go over to the site and take a look around, as Microsoft have released some great information about developer security in the past and it's an area of interest for me at the moment..<br />
But then I ran into a complete roadblock getting to the site!  To view it you have to have the latest version of Silverlight installed!  Unfortunately I think that won't work for a lot of users, either due to corporate builds not having deployed silverlight yet (and hopefully decent security policies in place to stop users self-deploying software) or due to platforms issues (admittedly a small proportion of linux fans like myself), although that said it's likely to be an increasing problem for some content, as a lot of mobile devices run Opera which isn't supported by silverlight from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/system-requirements.aspx">what I can see...</a><br />
I understand that Microsoft are keen to get people looking at some of their new technology, but it's a shame that this kind of resource is limited in such a way that a decent proportion of their target audience won't be able to use it....  Perhaps a limited HTML version could be made available so people without access to silverlight</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2008/01/09/new_years_resol/">New Years Resolution - Ask your Software vendors about security</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>It's the time of year for New resolutions, so I was thinking about what security people could do differently to help make 2008 better than 2007 for software security.<br />
One thing I came up with.  Speak to your purchasing people (if you've got some) or anyone else who approves software purchases in your company and get a criteria added to your purchasing policy that requires software vendors to explain how they ensure the security of the software they're selling you.<br />
After all, software companies are selling you products to help you run your business, and these days if they're selling you vulnerable products it's quite likely to have a negative effect on your company, either through security breaches which exploit the vulnerabilities or through the time you have to spend patching the software they provide.<br />
Now I'm not suggesting that any software you buy will be perfect, but if you make software security a criteria in whether you purchase "package A" or "package B" you give the vendors an incentive to improve the security of their software.<br />
Of course there's the problem of how you actually evaluate their claims...  At one level there's the obvious case of listening to what they tell you and asking some searching questions like<br />
"how many vulnerabilities has your product had in the last year" and "what's your policy towards vulnerability researchers and disclosure".  Beware of companies who say that their sofware has no vulnerabilities.  It's very likely that their either lying or in denial!<br />
Above that another option would be getting your suppliers to submit their software for an independent 3rd party assessment (like the ones <a href="http://www.veracode.com">Veracode</a> supply).  This probably works best for large companies buying critical applications, but I think it's a good idea, in principle anyway, as it helps validate a software suppliers claims of security.</p>

    <p>http://www.davidairey.co.uk/google-gmail-security-hijack/<br />
Here's an example of bad-guys using CSRF attacks try and extort money from domain name holders.  Interestingly it's the first example of practical use of this kind of attack I've seen.<br />
Although the vulnerability in GMail that seems to have been exploited is now fixed, I bet this won't be the last time we see this form of attack in use, and it does give an example of the kind of damage that a CSRF attack can cause...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2007/12/08/what_2008_may_b/">What 2008 may bring...</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Well as is kinda traditional in December various security bloggers have started predicting what 2008 will bring (there's some interesting thoughts and and links to more predictions <a href="http://securosis.com/2007/12/06/predicting-security-markets/"> here</a>).<br />
For my 0.02 of your local currency, I think that next years big topic will be Software Security.  A lot of the things we're seeing happen in the security market around exploding vulnerability metrics and malware all come ultimately down to poor software design and development.<br />
Now the industries reaction to this so far seems to be "here's another device for your network to help deal with this".  Not surprisingly this isn't a tenable long term strategy as you can't just keep layering on boxes before things start breaking.<br />
Also if you look at the Jericho concepts a key message is that systems have to be able to survive on their own without relying on an ever decreasing "perimeter".  Well in order to survive you've got to be well designed/written.  The model of hiding all your extremely vulnerable applications behind a big set of perimeter security devices won't work in the future.<br />
So what does this software security trend going to look like in terms of markets...?  Well I'd say that companies like <a href="http://www.veracode.com/"> Veracode</a>, <a href="http://www.fortifysoftware.com/"> Fortify</a> and <a href="http://www.ouncelabs.com/"> Ounce Labs</a> will do well over the coming year although perhaps for different reasons.<br />
Veracodes service sounds like it could be really useful in starting to answer the hard question "How do I know this software I'm buying is secure?".  Traditionally the most that was done was a black-box pen test of such software, and as people know black-box penetration testing is a lousy way to assure the security of anything.<br />
Fortify and Ounce make products which can help companies integrate security focused source code analysis into companies development processes.  I don't think that many companies have the business model that allows for the cost of a complete manual review of their codebases, so tools are necessary here to help the process scale.<br />
Of course no product is going to solve this sort of problem alone, so I'd hope to see more output along the lines of some of the OWASP projects, giving guidance on the design side aspect of producing secure software...</p>
