    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2007/02/16/why_microsofts/">Why Microsofts SDL may not lead to secure Microsoft Products</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was reading <a title="Wired: AP Technology and Business News from the Outside World on Wired.com" href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/M/MICROSOFT_SECURITY?SITE=WIRE&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">this article on Wired.com</a> about this months Microsoft patches when something occurred to me.<br />
Microsoft have done a huge amount of work on the security of their development practices and ensuring that there are fewer vulnerabilities in their products but what about "bought in" code?<br />
The reason this occurred to me is that the one vulnerability from this months set that affects Vista is in some of the A-V technology that they've acquired with companies like Sybari.<br />
So every time Microsoft buys a company and integrates their products into the existing Microsoft ones they potentially introduce a load of new vulnerabilities in code that probably won't have been through the same rigours as the internally developed code.  This is especially relevant where they are integrating products in security sensitive areas of the operating system like A-V and Anti-Spyware.<br />
Now Microsoft could of course re-write the codebase of any acquired technology before integrating it, but that would kinda' defeat the purpose of buying the company in the first place!</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's some information on a very nasty Solaris telnet vulnerability over at the <a href="http://www.computerdefense.org/?p=258"> Computer Defense blog</a>.<br />
Now hopefully this'll have limited impact 'cause all the solaris admins out there are running SSH already...<br />
Doubt it though, I've heard quite a few unix/router guys argue against dropping telnet in the past, so there's probably quite a few boxes out there using it...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2007/02/05/the_final_front/">The Final Frontier for Microsoft Security - Complexity</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's a really interesting posting at <a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=392">Visual Complexity</a> that provides a good illustration of what I think Microsofts main remaining problem in regards to security is.<br />
MS have done tons of work in improving their code quality, improving their default builds and adding features like Address space layout randomization (ALSR) to make hacking into their products harder.<br />
The one area that's left is complexity.  Ultimately the more code that is installed on a system the more code there is to be attacked, either remotely or locallly.  what the graphs from visual complexity show is that for web servers IIS on windows has more potentially active code that Apache on Linux.<br />
Hopefully some of the other stories that have <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070129-8728.html">surfaced recently</a> will lead to the possibility of having a very stripped down Windows OS if you need it...</p>

    <p><a title="Jeremiah Grossman: The difference between Security Assessments and Penetration Tests" href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2007/01/difference-between-security-assessments.html">Jeremiah Grossman: The difference between Security Assessments and Penetration Tests</a><br />
Interesting post from Jeremiah Grossman on the differences between security assessments  and Penetration Tests.<br />
He's pretty much captured all the salient points and it's well worth reading as it's a pretty common point of confusion (even amongst general InfoSec people)<br />
One thing that strikes me about it, is it leads to the question "When would I want a penetration test then?".  The answer seems to me to be "only when you're pretty confident that it won't find anything!"<br />
The reason for this is that until everything is locked down and sorted you should be doing security assessment style reviews which try to find all the available security weaknesses and only when you're comfortable that it should all be right do you engage with a penetration testing team to try that black box "try and break in" approach.<br />
The other point would be, if you can only afford to have one type of review done, a penetration test probably isn't a good idea, in that whilst it will prove if you can be broken into (at a given point in time by a given person), there's still the likelihood that there are other ways of breaking in that haven't been found as the penetration tester probably won't keep looking once they're in...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2007/01/28/firefox_extensi/">(Firefox) Extension Security</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Here's one that I think will be a growing problem... 3rd party extension security.  I'll use Firefox as an example as it uses this kind of system, but I don't think that the problem is limited to Firefox.<br />
So you've got a piece of software from an organisation you trust (whether you should or not's a different question), in this case the Firefox browser.  You download it and install it from the main site (hey if you're good you even check the MDS5SUM to make sure it's as packaged)<br />
Now one of the best features of Firefox is the extensive range of extensions that are available to add useful functionality to the browser.  things like noscript or web developer are real handy things to have and I definitely install them every time I install Firefox.<br />
Now here's the problem... do you trust the people that wrote those plug-ins, or an even wider question, do you trust the security of the environment that those plug-ins were developed in?  Do you even know who the person who wrote the plug-in is?<br />
Some people may say "why do I care it's just a browser", yeah but do you do E-Commerce and put your credit card details into webpages? Do you do on-line banking?  do you use a browser for it?<br />
A very brief read uncovered one instance of a rogue plug-in last year (more <a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/191101268"> here</a> and <a href="http://www.heise-security.co.uk/news/76019"> here</a> ) but I doubt it'll be the last.<br />
One thing I've not read up on yet is what security model there is for what actions a plug-in can take when installed... my instinct says that in this case there's not too much restriction, but worth investigating anyway.</p>

If an exploit for this becomes available then expect a lot of problems...</p>

    <p><a title="ryanlrussell: Vulnerability Pimps" href="http://ryanlrussell.blogspot.com/2007/01/vulnerability-pimps.html">ryanlrussell: Vulnerability Pimps</a><br />
Some very interesting commentary which follows on from a posting on Marcus Ranums site <a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/codetools/index.html"> here </a> which is in itself very interesting..<br />
All good stuff if your interested in Software security but the piece that caught my eye is right at the end of the comments section<br />
<i><br />
I'm hearing from the vulnerability pimps that, yes, code security is improving. They are reporting that it's much harder to find a remote hole in the current operating systems.<br />
</i><br />
So security on operating systems is getting better... not really a surprise given the battering they've had and the level of resource that people like Microsoft are putting into it.<br />
But... reckon that the hackers will go home now ?  Of course not, they'll move on and I reckon that the place they'll go is all those other software applications that people install on their systems that come from vendors who maybe haven't woken up to the necessity of secure coding.<br />
Sure it'll be harder for hackers to get coverage on as many systems 'cause there aren't all that many software monopolies out there, but I'm sure that's where they'll go.<br />
So a good time to be asking the suppliers of all your applications what they do about software security.  Do they do security code audits? what tools to they use for those audits?  Have all their developers had secure development training?</p>

    <p>Interesting post from Nitesh dhanjani <a href="http://www.dhanjani.com/archives/2007/01/your_gmail_contact_list_is_han.html">here</a> pointing out a problem with Gmail contact lists being available to malicious website owners.<br />
Now this only works if you're logged into gmail, but if you've used it recently and not explicitly logged out... then it'll keep you logged in...<br />
Now google should obviously fix this problem, but I think that there is a wider point here.  Don't leave yourself logged in to websites and be very wary about what you let your browser manage for you security-wise as it's not very security wise (oh I crack myself up ;o)</p>
