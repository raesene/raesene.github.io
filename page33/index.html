some coverage here of the case of Daniel Cuthbert who's been convicted of breach of the Computer Misuse Act for (if the articles I've read are accurate) putting ../../../ into a URL to see if a site he'd just given his credit card to was insecure..<br />
I'm in two minds about this case, on the one hand he shouldn't have done that really it could be construed as an attack and he should've realised that it would trip IDS (although how quiet must they've been in the BT offices that they were investigating ever IDS alarm of that type!)<br />
On the other hand, the Internet is a public place and websites are public resources by definition (unless they have access control configured).  what concerns me is that people accessing websites in unusual ways run the risk of being prosecuted..  for example if they see a parameter in a URL and think "I'll just skip ahead by changing that by 5 instead of clicking forward 5 times" ... is that a breach of the computer misuse act..?<br />
also it's waaay to easy to abuse this kind of thing.. how long before someone sends an email with a link which has something like "../../../" in it , causing a recipient who clicks it to appear to be a "hacker"...<br />
Not sure either of those are great reasons, but this case does make me feel uncomfortable for some reason.</p>

This is a liitle bit scary... The terrorist watch list has an AFGHANI MAN using an alias of McPhee on it... and they start stopping an AMERICAN WOMAN because her surname is McPhee.....<br />
I actually think I can see why something like this might happen. I reckon that the culture in this environment is one where  everyone is really scared of making a mistake that leads to a successful terrorist attack so they follow instructions to the letter, no matter how stupid..<br />
The only problem is that that approach ignores the opportunity cost and allows people to avoid your checks<br />
- if you spend loads of time with people who are not really suspects, there's less time to look for people who are...<br />
- if you rely on stupid basic measures like surnames, then it's really easy for someone who needs to (and doesn't mind breaking the law), to avoid them...</p>

Review of a very interesting product from Airmagnet.  I've used their laptop analyser product, which is great for Wireless Security Site Surveys, but the spectrum analyser is more focused on the performance site survey side of things.<br />

    <p>Following on from Marcus Ranum's piece on the six dumbest ideas in computer security <a href="http://raesene.dnsalias.net/blog/archives/000270.html"> which I talked about earlier </a> there's been some chat on the CISSPforum which mentions some companies which have software which moves away from the idea of badness enumerators and more towards the idea of whitelists for allowed software...<br />
I've not had a good chance to review the products, but sounds very interesting in concept at least.<br />
these are the two I've seen mentioned, but I'd be interested to hear of any others....<br />

Interesting article on Microsofts continued moved to improve the security in their new applications...<br />
It's good stuff and I'm very happy to see the quantity of information about software security that Microsoft make available for free on their website...  Hopefully will encourage windows developers in general to take software security more seriously...<br />
Now all Microsoft need to do is allow users to not to have to install millions of lines of unnecessary code on servers (hint think Media player, Internet Explorer etc) and re-write the older legacy code that still seems to cause problems, and they'll be sorted :o)</p>

  </h2>

Link from Bruce Schneir's blog to an article by Marcus Ranum. As always some interesting thoughts, this time about the dumbest ideas in security, some of which I agree with and some which I'm not so sure about.<br />
The 1st, default permit I'd agree with.  Default Permit is all over IT.  One example which I think is interesting but not mentioned is URL filtering.  Any company I've seen run a default permit and blacklist concept for web traffic filtering. Whilst I can see why that would work from a usability perspective, it's next to useless from a security standpoint.  As soon as you allow access to unknown sites, you're allowing access to everything as users can use one of the variety of tunnelling or proxying programs to get access to all the content you've blocked, as can any virii or worms that might get installed..<br />
Enumerating badness, yeah, I like it in principle, although I do think that Marcus is understating the level of complexity in enumerating the goodness.  Sure there may be only 20-30 programs you use in an interactive sense, there are many more pieces of code executed that you're not aware of...<br />
Penetrate and Patch.  This is a well made point, in that code should be designed to be secure, as should systems. However I'm not convinced of the wortlessness of penetration testing.  Once you've designed your secure system and implemented it, shouldn't someone test that it actually is secure?<br />
Number four's a bit of a "yeah but no" point.  Yeah hacking isn't cool (in the criminal sense of hacking) but understanding how you're current adversary operates, is to my mind, useful.....<br />
Number Five... nah ain't buying it.  The implication of this point is that user education has done nothing for security, because there are still some users who don't behave securely... so should we not take any countermeasures unless they're going to be 100% successful!?  User education has done a lot for security it's just, like all other countermeasuers  not perfect...<br />
Number Six, I'll go along with, the number of people who seem ready to jump on the latest security bandwagon, whilst still not doing the fundamentals of good security operations well never ceases to amaze me...<br />
All interesting stuff though and well worth a read...</p>
