Looks from this article like we'll be seeing some patent lawsuits soon in the security world.  This is a good example of what I don't like about software patents, an overly broad patent, for which there may well be prior art, but in order to challenge it there will now have to be an expensive court case out of which no-one will win but the lawyers!!!<br />

Dana has a link from a link on Axel's blog to a great article about Security and economics by Ross Anderson(Gee blogging gets a bit overly linked at times :op)...<br />
As with a lot of Ross Andersons writings it's very thought provoking, with many interesting ideas in it.  A recommended read even if you're not into InfoSec as it provides one possible explanation for things like why Microsoft dominates certain computing markets....<br />
One of the many interesting ideas in it was an analysis of why even the best funded security team can fall foul of a relatively poorly funded attacked in the computing world (starts on Page 4)</p>

There's an interesting story on Slashdot, linking to a study on password quality, it has a couple of interesting conclusions amongst some other confirmations of common themes in password quality.  Most interesting is probably the conclusion that in practice mnemonic passwords are as strong as randomly chosen passwords and are far easier to remember....</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2004/0518moredetai.html?fsrc=rss-security">New evidence points to Cisco network hack</a><br />
An article providing some more info on the Cisco code theft, over at Network World.  One point mentioned in it that I would disagree with though is the comment that<br />
"Unlike open source software products, the security of Cisco's systems, like those of other proprietary software vendors, depends on the source code being kept out of public view, he said"<br />
This is a bit on the sweeping side really...  Although it is a salutory lesson that companies shouldn't rely on the secrecy of their code to provide security.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2004/0517mssecurity.html?fsrc=rss-security">Redmond enlists security vendors to automate policy compliance</a><br />
An interesting idea talked about over at Network world, is Microsoft working with A-V vendors on the idea of security policy compliance software.  If I'm reading it correctly, the idea is that when an machine tries to log onto a Microsoft network it's agent software will transmit information about things like it's A-V pattern files and patch level and if these don't meet defined standards it will not be able to connect, until it was updated.<br />
It's a good idea for things like laptop users, who perhaps aren't in the office often enough to get updates.  That said I like the idea of this being tied into the network switch/router infrastructure more.<br />
The reason being is that even if a PC can't log onto a windows domain it can still connect to other client-server applications, whereas if the switch the PC is connected to, won't let it communicate with anything other than the update server untill it is patched, it will be a more effective control.</p>

A link to an interesting article at securityfocus talking about the prerequisites for getting into network security.  My path was train as an accountant, get lucky and move over to IT before having to do any accounts, spend 5 years in Networking and general IT, then move into IT security.  I've found my background in IT to be very useful when having security related conversations with IT staff, it definately helps to understand where they're coming from and also if they might be being "economical" with the truth...<br />
There's another reference to this story over at <a href="http://users.757.org/~joat/blog/archives/002511.html">Joat's blog </a>, which mentions coding as a required skill.  I've picked up bits of a couple of languages over the years, and I'd like to learn more, but I've never been sure which language would be best to focus on, with the inevitable result that I've not really learned any of them....</p>
