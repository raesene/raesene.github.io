  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've been reading quite a few posts about Microsofts COFEE toolkit which seems to be designed to help forensics investigators get evidence from (presumably windows based) PCs.<br />
It's amazing to see how many sources on the Internet took the original article <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004379751_msftlaw29.html">here</a> from the Seattle times and came to the conclusion that this was some magical box of tricks that would instantly bypass windows security, as opposed to just being a useful collection of forensics tools, examples of this response are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/385476/microsoft-cofee-wont-perk-you-up-but-it-will-instamagically-hack-your-computer">here</a>, <a href="http://artofinfosec.com/56/hackers-holy-grail-redefined-by-microsoft/">here</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/info/6hj9y/comments/">here</a> and <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/29/1441215"> here</a><br />
Luckily someone at the Seattle Times did some follow-up with Microsoft to confirm that it's actually just a collection of forensics tools and doesn't bypass windows security <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/techtracks/2008/04/looking_for_answers_on_microsofts_cofee_device.html"> here </a></p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2008/04/24/pci_66_clarific/">PCI 6.6 clarification - Am I missing something?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Recently there have been some clarifications around a couple of sections of the PCI-DSS, in particular one on <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/infosupp_6_6_applicationfirewalls_codereviews.pdf">section 6.6 </a>.<br />
This update has created some comment and articles but none of the ones I've read has focused on the main point, as far as I can see...<br />
<b>Previously there were two options for satisfying Section 6.6</b></p>
<ul>
<li> A Code Review (either manual or tool assisted) of in-scope web applications, or</li>
<li>Placement of an appropriately configured Web Application Firewall to protect the application</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Now (unless I'm reading this incorrectly) there's an additional one</b><br />
Completion of a manual or assisted web application vulnerability review...<br />
The confusing part is that this third option isn't split out but is listed under the "application code review" section.<br />
My feeling is that this'll affect a lot of merchants (and vendors) if they were planning on either spending money on WAFs or Code reviews and will now use a standard web application review (which they may already be undertaking as part of other security work....)<br />
Another interesting point which I don't know the answer to is whether a single review which covered both penetration testing techniques and web application assessment techniques could be used to satisfy 6.6 and 11.3...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2008/04/08/security_shorth/">Security Shorthand problems</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was thinking about a story I saw recently about the <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/08/04/06/1641201.shtml"> recent update to the british banking code</a><br />
There's a lot of discussion about Internet banking users potentially being liable for fraud if their PCs aren't "secure", as a result of this update.<br />
The code says <i>"Keep your PC secure. Use up-to-date anti-virus and spyware software and a personal firewall."</i><br />
This leads to comments of "I use Mac|Linux I don't use A-V does that mean I'll be liable"<br />
So what we have here is, failure to communicate...<br />
The BBA appear to be correlating having basic software security packages installed with being secure.  What I expect happened is that they needed to give some kind of shorthand guidance and that was the best they could come up with.<br />
The problem is that without more detailed guidance fraud teams in banks may use this as the definition of secure and treat anyone who falls outside it as being at fault, which would put a lot of the more Internet security savvy people in the "not secure" bucket.<br />
Personally I run Linux at home and I don't use A-V as there's no credible threat that it would mitigate for me....</p>

    <p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7334249.stm<br />
This time HSBC have lost 370,000 sets of personal details from insurance customers.  One thing that puzzles me in the reporting of this story is the statement that<br />
<b><i>although the data on the disc was protected by a password it had not been encrypted</i></b><br />
How do you password protect something without encrypting it ?!  Any software I'm aware of that does password protection will at very least use some form of rudimentary encryption (eg, old versions of winzip or office) or in most cases (pgp, modern office/winzip versions) perfectly acceptable levels of encryption for most scenarios...</p>

<p>Interesting to see someone have a shot a putting numbers on how far Oracle are behind Microsoft in the database security arena (well secure features as opposed to security features anyway).  The number that they come up with is 5 years...<br />
Assuming that nothing turns up soon it actually looks like SQL Server 2005 will go through it's whole product lifecycle without a published vulnerability.  <a href="http://secunia.com/product/6782/">Secunia</a> are currently showing it affected by 0 vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2008/03/08/february_owasp/">February OWASP meeting</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The February meeting of the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland">scottish OWASP chapter</a> went pretty well on the 28th.<br />
We had Steve Moyle doing a presentation on Database security (slides can be found <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-scotland/attachments/20080306/626374c3/attachment-0001.ppt"> here</a> )<br />
I picked up some interesting ideas from his presentation.  Firstly the idea that relational databases have a fundamental flaw when it comes to security, which is that the channel used to control them and the channel used to access the information they contain, are the same.  This allows for someone who should only have access to information in the system to easily attack it as well.<br />
The other thought which occurred to me when I was listening to the presentation was that any IDS/IPS style device which wants to block "malicious" traffic going to a system needs to parse the information it's seeing <i> in the same way as the protected system </i> otherwise there's a risk that quirks of rendering will introduce false positives or negatives.<br />
It's something I was talking to a WAF vendor about recently, as I was asking them whether their product rendered JavaScript when looking for malicious traffic, as there's a specific problem with the idea of self-modifying JavaScript, looking innocuous in transit but then being malicious when executed</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's a couple of good security events coming up in Scotland which should be a great chance to meet some of the security community up here and also hear some good speakers!<br />
On the 28th of February, there's an OWASP Scotland meeting with Dr Steven Moyle of <a href="http://www.secerno.com/">Secerno</a> doing a talk on Database Security.  There's more information and the address to RSVP to on the <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-scotland/2008-February/000010.html">OWASP Scotland Mailing list</a><br />
Next up on the 27th of March is the latest <a href="http://www.securetest.com/">Securetest Edinburgh RANT</a> with Graeme Marsh from <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/home/0,1044,stc%253DHOME%2526lid%253D7,00.html?WT.mc_id=UKGoogle_NatAd">Deloittes</a> doing a talk on "Plugging the Gap - Information Leakage in Organisations".

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2008/02/01/interesting_new/">Interesting new site?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>There's a post over at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hackers/archive/2008/01/31/hellosecureworld-com-launched.aspx"> Microsoft %41%43%45%20%54%65%61%6d blog</a> about their new Hello secure world resource.<br />
When I saw this I thought I'd go over to the site and take a look around, as Microsoft have released some great information about developer security in the past and it's an area of interest for me at the moment..<br />
But then I ran into a complete roadblock getting to the site!  To view it you have to have the latest version of Silverlight installed!  Unfortunately I think that won't work for a lot of users, either due to corporate builds not having deployed silverlight yet (and hopefully decent security policies in place to stop users self-deploying software) or due to platforms issues (admittedly a small proportion of linux fans like myself), although that said it's likely to be an increasing problem for some content, as a lot of mobile devices run Opera which isn't supported by silverlight from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/system-requirements.aspx">what I can see...</a><br />
I understand that Microsoft are keen to get people looking at some of their new technology, but it's a shame that this kind of resource is limited in such a way that a decent proportion of their target audience won't be able to use it....  Perhaps a limited HTML version could be made available so people without access to silverlight</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2008/01/09/new_years_resol/">New Years Resolution - Ask your Software vendors about security</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>It's the time of year for New resolutions, so I was thinking about what security people could do differently to help make 2008 better than 2007 for software security.<br />
One thing I came up with.  Speak to your purchasing people (if you've got some) or anyone else who approves software purchases in your company and get a criteria added to your purchasing policy that requires software vendors to explain how they ensure the security of the software they're selling you.<br />
After all, software companies are selling you products to help you run your business, and these days if they're selling you vulnerable products it's quite likely to have a negative effect on your company, either through security breaches which exploit the vulnerabilities or through the time you have to spend patching the software they provide.<br />
Now I'm not suggesting that any software you buy will be perfect, but if you make software security a criteria in whether you purchase "package A" or "package B" you give the vendors an incentive to improve the security of their software.<br />
Of course there's the problem of how you actually evaluate their claims...  At one level there's the obvious case of listening to what they tell you and asking some searching questions like<br />
"how many vulnerabilities has your product had in the last year" and "what's your policy towards vulnerability researchers and disclosure".  Beware of companies who say that their sofware has no vulnerabilities.  It's very likely that their either lying or in denial!<br />
Above that another option would be getting your suppliers to submit their software for an independent 3rd party assessment (like the ones <a href="http://www.veracode.com">Veracode</a> supply).  This probably works best for large companies buying critical applications, but I think it's a good idea, in principle anyway, as it helps validate a software suppliers claims of security.</p>
