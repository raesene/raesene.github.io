  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2014/11/02/changing-times-end-of-sms-auth/">Changing Times - End of SMS Auth?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>So like most things in security, decisions are made based on a set of assumptions, and it’s when these assumptions prove to be faulty that security can go quite badly wrong.</p>

<p>I was thinking about a fairly common assumption recently in light of Apple’s new <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6337">continuity</a> feature.  Over the last couple of years as the weaknesses in password based authentication models become ever more apparent, there’s obviously been a drive to improve authentication, and one method of doing this is through the use of different channels to send authentication tokens “out of band”.</p>

<p>One of the more common methods of doing this is to send authentication tokens over SMS messages.  The theory is that this is a separate channel from the PC or tablet that is the primary device being used, so it should be harder for an attacker to compromise both channels, thereby improving security.</p>

<p>For example if we have an attacker who has access to a users PC (for example having placed malware on it which steals passwords and other data entered there), the idea goes, by adding in SMS, we make it harder for the attacker to compromise the whole authentication mechanism.</p>

<p>You can probably see, based on the starting paragraph, where this assumption is starting to fall down… With features like Continuity or, SMS to email applications or phone carriers who provide websites which allow for viewing and sending SMS messages, the barrier between these two channels is effectively pierced and SMS becomes much less useful as a second factor for authentication.</p>

<p>Now if an attacker can compromise the PC, it’s quite likely that they’ll get access to the users SMS messages at the same time, with all that entails.</p>

<p>Hopefully this line of thinking will penetrate with service operators and they’ll realise that if 2-factor/channel authentication is needed for their service, they’ll need to offer something more robustly separate.</p>

<p>The other thing I thought this was an interesting illustration of, is that this to me is a good example of differing incentives in the security world.  Online service provides have the incentive for SMS messaging to be a good 2nd channel for authentication data as it’s something that almost all their subscribers already have access to, and it’s very cheap to use.</p>

<p>On the other hand, mobile operators and mobile ecosystem providers have no such incentive.  Instead they’re working to make it easier for users to access all their information in a single place….</p>

    <p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last couple of days you will have noticed a bit of a kerfuffle about a vulnerability in OpenSSL.  One of the more notable parts of this story has been the wide variety of large companies who have been seriously affected by the problem.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2014/04/01/house-of-cards/">House of Cards</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was reading <a href="http://www.ramshackleglam.com/2014/04/01/my-website-was-stolen-by-a-hacker-and-i-got-it-back/">this post</a> and I was thinking that this is another good example of the general theme in a lot of modern business and security.</p>

<p>People will a lot of times neglect some of the “plumbing” of their website and not realise quite how important it is to their sites security.  In the linked example it was DNS.  An attacker was able to get control of the site domain name and then essentially controlled the site. That’s one way of pulling it off but there are others.</p>

<p>Good examples of services which are often overlooked but are critical</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosting services.  If you use VPS or the like and the hosting service is compromised then, the attackers can likely get access to your servers too.  A good example of this was the Linode hack in 2013.  There the attackers didn’t even have Linode as a primary target, they were after one specific customer.</li>
  <li>DNS providers.  If the attacker can control your DNS, they can redirect mail, carry out MITM attacks on web sites, basically make a right mess of your system.  But hacks on DNS providers (either social engineering or direct) are a common theme in stories of compromise.</li>
  <li>E-Mail providers.  Might not seem as critical, but how are most password resets done…. by E-Mail.  If the attacker owns your e-mail service they can usually trigger password resets for other things like DNS or hosting.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what makes me say these things are “neglected”?  Well look at the market and it’s pretty obvious.  In a lot of cases the successful providers in these areas are the cheapest/easiest to use, not the most secure.  Of course there’s the usual security problem of a “market for lemons” in that all providers will say that they’re secure but I’d still recommend that if you have a system that’s important to you (and that’s true for an increasing number of companies who do business primarily on-line), then spending some time trying to find high quality “plumbing” will pay off in the long run.</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I was doing a talk for the OWASP meeting in Glasgow the other day, which covered the OWASP Top 10.  I had made the point that the Top 10 is largely the same now (in it’s 2013 iteration) as it was in it’s original iteration in 2003. Someone asked me a question based on that which (roughly) was “Why isn’t security getting better?”</p>
