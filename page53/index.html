    <p>Eweek are carrying <a title="Linux vs. Windows: Which Is More Secure?" href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1557749,00.asp">a story</a> covering some forrester research comparing vulnerability levels and response times across a range of vendors.<br />
The thing that always strikes me about this kind of research is whether they are comparing like with like.  For example if they are comparing ALL vulnerabilities on Microsoft software with ALL vulnerabilities in software in a given Linux Distrabution, then thats really a bit meaningless in the real world.  I mean who's going to have all that software installed in a given environment.<br />
A far more meaningful way of presenting the information would be to establish typical usage profiles, for example "corporate desktop" or "web server" state what packages those would contain and then measure the vendors based on the vulnerability levels present.<br />
My gut feeling, although I could be wrong, is that Microsoft would probably come out worst in that kind of analysis, as many of the vulnerabilities they have had recently have been in core parts of their system (ASN.1 being a good example) which would appear in every loadset, and of course the fact that they're overall strategy seems to involve a lot of integration of systems, leading to a larger overall attack surface.</p>

There's a story over at newsforge covering a new Open Source Vulnerability database.  It's not too clear to me at the  moment how this differs from things like CERT?</p>

    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2004/03/31/complexity_of_p/">Complexity of patching at microsoft</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a title="Zone-H.org * News" href="http://www.zone-h.org/en/news/read/id=4139/">This Story over at Zone-H.org</a> makes an interesting point about Eeye's outstanding vulnerabities which they've reported to Microsoft.<br />
One point of view that you could take from this is that Microsoft is pretty famous for the amount of integration in its products, and as the number of products and the amount of code in those products increases, the cost and time required to fix a vulnerability will also increase.  On the <a href="http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Upcoming/index.html"> Eeye page</a> you can see that they've got vulnerabilites that they reported to Microsoft 200+ days agot which they regard as critical and which have not been patched.<br />
Given Eeye's approach of non-disclosure this isn't too serious a problem, however if we assume that Microsoft has been working hard to patch these problems (and we've no reason to assume that's not the case), what would happen if they got an equally serious vulnerability from a source who believed in publishing after only say 10 days of notification or even worse one who decided to post expkoit code first and ask questions later!<br />
If it takes 200+ days to patch the problem, that would leave a pretty large window of exploitation and potentially a lot of damage to systems around the world.</p>

This story over at ZDnet is covering ISS's insistance that only customers with maintenance contracts will get patches for the vulnerability in their products caused by the witty worm...<br />
I really hope this isn't a continuing theme amoungst software vendors as the only result will be an increasing number of machines that will never be patched against malicious code.<br />
Also I've got to say that I'm really suprised to see this stance from a vendor of security products, as you would think that they of all people would understand the consequences of leaving people with faulty firewall software!</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2004/03/30/information_app/">Information Appliance Tap.</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>First off I'm thinking of a ethernet style tap not a water one ;op<br />
I was thinking today, more and more people are connected to broadband these days, if I was selling information appliances, by which I'm thinking about dedicated pieces of hardware which process information (like the <a href="http://www.amstrad.co.uk/default.shtml">Amstrad emailer</a>), I'd want to be able to tap into the broadband connection, but I wouldn't want to try and guide non-technical users through the hassle of setting up some form of internet connection sharing (NAT) be it software or hardware.<br />
So, what if I just tapped into the connection.... If you attached a network bridge to the ethernet side of a ADSL modem (between the PC and the ADSL modem) you'd be able to see all the traffic as it goes by...<br />
Then use UDP to send traffic upstream to your server, that way it doesn't matter if you don't have an IP address for your device, UDP data is stateless so no problem...<br />
Then there's the reverse, i.e. can the server send to the device?  That part would require the device to work out what the IP address of the PC it's installed next to is, but given that it can see traffic as it goes by, it can just pull the address from the packet stream.  So once it's got the address it gives that to its server and then if the server sends UDP traffic to that IP address (obviously on a port that the PC isn't listening on) the tap will pick it up and be able to use it....<br />
The advantage to all this is that you can send traffic on a users broadband connection without disturbing their existing environment at all..<br />
there are some downsides though.  You'd need to put all the intelligence in things like authentication into the application level of the device (otherwise you'd be a great target for forged traffic from unscrupulous types)</p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Over at <a href="http://www.securitynews.net/spoof/index.html"> Securitynews.net </a> they've got a cool example of using graphical elements to create the illusion of a secure site...  Of course if you're not running IE on windows XP it just looks odd.<br />
Although with enough work that might be possible to overcome, by detecting the user agent requesting the page and presenting a suitable fake UI experience.... (of course you could always foil them by using Lynx ;op)</p>
