  <div>
    
    
    <p>Over at <a title="Schneier on Security: Desktop Google Finds Holes" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/desktop_google.html">Schneier on Security</a>, there's a refreshingly sensible piece on Google's desktop search.<br />
As Bruce points out, all that information that people are getting so worried about being found by the tool is ALREADY THERE, so if there's a shared PC and you're worried about people seeing the data of other users... Don't give them the rights to see those areas!!<br />
If you're worried that users using Internet Cafe's will expose corporate data by it being indexed when it's put on the Internet Cafe PC, set your policy and technical controls so that you're users don't put corporate data on untrusted machines!!<br />
Sorry, but the flow of "Google desktop is evil" stories made me cranky...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2004/11/29/is_microsoft_cr/">Interesting opinion piece on Internet Explorer security</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a title="Is Microsoft creating tomorrow's IE security holes today? | The Register" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/29/ie_security_holes/">Is Microsoft creating tomorrow's IE security holes today? | The Register</a><br />
Quite an interesting piece, wondering whether Microsoft is creating problems for itself in the future with IE, with amongst other things, tight integration with the OS.<br />
I do disagree with one or two point made though, especially "<em>Rapid development cycles won the browser wars, and it wasn't the strong-arming or the marketing that motivated users to switch browsers, it was the features</em>"<br />
My memory of it was that IE wasn't <em>that</em> much more featureful than Netscape Navigator, and if you want to know my opinion of why Microsoft won that war it is the plain and simple fact of being bundled on the desktop when Navigator wasn't.  Non-technical users do not go looking for alternate products, so long as the default one they're provided with does a reasonable job.<br />
In fact it's telling that Firefox is gaining ground on IE, as that says to me that a percentage of Internet users no longer regard IE as doing a reasonable job.<br />
Back to the story, I'd agree that tight OS integration is to my mind a problem for IE.  I see no reason why an Operating system <strong>has</strong> to have an Internet Browser.  Definately for server operating systems it seems totally redundant (although in several use cases I add that a GUI on a server is a waste of resouces).<br />
From a security point of view having components so tightly integrated into the OS that an administrator cannot easily remove (not disable) them just increases the amount of code that needs maintained and increases the likelihood that code on the server will have an exploitable security vulnerability....</p>

While I'm not sure if this is the "major UK Site" referred to in the previous posting, there's some information about a compromise of one of the registers advert suppliers in the story above..<br />
It's really quite a cunning plan by whoever carried it out, as they've realised that you only need to compromise one set of servers (the advertising company) in order to potentially infect many of their clients.....<br />
One thought that occurs to me from this is that you have to wonder whether sites should be taking steps to validate adverts and any other 3rd party content which is provided by frames on their site..... (heck imagine if someone managed to compromise the servers which provide those advertising boxes provided by search engine companies!!!)</p>

Over at the ISC handlers diary there's mention of a major (unnamed) uk website which has a pointer to a site hosting the Bofra/IFrame Internet Explorer exploit (for which there is currently no patch!)<br />
Another really good reason not to use Internet Explorer on the web unless you really have to...</p>

He makes some very valid points about why running Windows machines as an administrator is a very bad idea(tm) unless absolutely required.<br />
Also there's information on a useful technique to reduce your privileges when running specific applications, aimed at providing a safer web browsing experience.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://raesene.github.io/blog/2004/11/17/couple_of_inter_1/">couple of Interesting phishing Stories</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>First one's the story that <a title="Phishing scam forces NatWest services offline - vnunet.com" href="http://www.vnunet.com/news/1159481">Phishing scam forces NatWest services offline - vnunet.com</a>.  What I find somewhat odd about this is that they took the step of disabling some functionality on their site...<br />
They must have had quite a few of these scams by now and I find it hard to believe that they're disabling parts of their websites every time they get hit, as that would seem a bit like a self-imposed Denial-Of-Service...<br />
Another story about how some customers are dealing with phishing <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-5453203.html?tag=default"> here </a>.  Basically the guy in this story is blanket deleting mails looking for personal info. seems like a sound idea to me!.<br />
Personally I think that standard SMTP e-mail is just about dead as a Business to Consumer communication method.   Between SPAM, phishing and malware there's no way consumers and home users are going to keep using this.  Really companies should not have been using what has always been a really insecure mechanism to communicate with their customers.<br />
The thing is though, it's REALLY cheap compared with most other forms of communications (notably this is what the spammers depend on as well to make money) so they've been very reluctant to stop.<br />
My expectation is that they will have to find some way to clearly and securely provide communications with their customers to bridge the gap left by E-Mail.  Not that that's an easy problem to solve...</p>

    <p>There's a review of Network vulnerability assessment tools over at <a title="Network vulnerability assessment management" href="http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2004/110804rev.html?fsrc=rss-security">nwfusion.com</a><br />
I thought it was interesting to see that there are several products in the review based on the nessus engine...<br />
Also one point that intruiged me when I read it was the companies that declined to take part.  Maybe it's just me, but when I read that it tends to make me think "I wonder what was wrong with their product" ie If you think that your product is the best on the market, I would expect that you'd be very keen to see it reviewed and recognised as such....</p>
