    <p>Came across a tool that should help make light work of the research phase of a penetration test today. <a href="http://www.paterva.com/web/Evolution/">Paterva Evolution</a>.<br />
Essentially seem to be a nice graphical way of establishing connections related to a specific resource.  So for example, any email addresses that are findable relating to a given domain name.<br />
Of course that kind of research can be done manually, but this is an awful lot slicker!</p>

    <p>Well I'm back from (sometimes) sunny shetland.  Thanks to some rain and a laptop I'd taken I got some work done on a tool I've started developing for my SANS GSOC gold paper.<br />
<a href="http://rorascanner.rubyforge.org">RoraScanner</a> is a Oracle 10G security scanner written in ruby.  I'm enjoying writing it at the moment as it's let me develop my ruby skills and my oracle skills at the same time.<br />
Hopefully it'll also become a reasonably useful security scanner!</p>

One of those times when I start writing a comment on a post and end up rambling for so long that it ends up being worth a post...<br />
--<br />
I'll chime in on the OWASP needs some staff line.  I know they've got loads of great people running it but I reckon they could benefit from some people to focus on specific areas of OWASP.<br />
A good example.. the website.  Wikis are great for some types of site and information but personally I think that finding things on the current OWASP site is harder than it should be.<br />
The only way that I've found to tell what's happening on the site seems to be to look at the wiki recent changes list, which isn't a very user friendly experience.<br />
Also some of the great information that is on there is not well flagged up.  An example would be <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools">this page </a>  which has a really cool list of web app. security stuff but I only found it digging through the diffs, usually I wouldn't think to go into a specific chapter to find that.<br />
Another example, where I think a permanent staff member would be useful, is administering the SPOC projects and chivying the people assigned to them for updates.<br />
Right now it's rapidly turning into a summer/autumn of code not spring <b>;o)</b> . the status page that's gone up has all the projects at 0% complete !<br />
All In all I think OWASP are doing some great work, a lot of which may be less appreciated 'cause it's not as discoverable as it could be....</p>

    <p>I've had to switch comments and trackbacks off on the blog at the moment.  Turns out that my little converted NAS box that I've moved over to is great at static content but not so good a CGIs, so when comment/trackback spammers hit it a lot it overheats!<br />
Going to look into maybe moving the blog to a hosted solution, so hopefully get all back to normal when that happens...<br />
<b>Edit:</b> I've tried something which *may* sort the problem so comments back on for now...</p>

    <p>I've had the blog running in a virtual machine for a while since the power supply on my server blew, but that's it back onto dedicated hardware now..<br />
In fact it's a nice little debian server using a Buffalo Linkstation Pro reflashed with <a href="http://linkstationwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page">FreeLink</a>.<br />
Pretty good deal as you get a perfectly good linux server based on a 130 pound piece of hardware.  I've got two of them running now, one as a web server and one as a file/print server.  There a lot smaller an quieter than running full-tower cases in the office!</p>

There may be loads of companies left in the security community waiting to get bought up, but there's only really Cenzic left of the original top 4 web application scanning tools left, and some other up-and-coming scanners like Acunetix WVS maybe as well.</p>

Well I'm gong to try and answer Hoffs question on standards I think need to exist before ADAPT or any other data classification and security programme will work... But first thing a question of my own..  Where does he get all those cool graphics!<br />
Anyway so we're tagging all our data. For that to happen I'm thinking that the tags need to be attached to each "document" that flows over the network.  Now we've got a wide variety of documents in place we've got all our MS office docs. we've got XML files we've got binary blobs from proprietary programs, we've got encrypted files.  Many of these have no native facility to insert any sort of metadata tag.  So without that how do we attach a meaningful tag to the data?  If we modify the document in infrastructure after it's been constructed our device which does this will need to understand every data/file format that we want to tag, and I think that's a very tricky thing to do.<br />
So I think that in order to do this effectively you need a standard which all programs which construct documents will use to tag their data, so that all the infrastructure devices can read those tags and act on them...<br />
Now the question I've got for Hoff is ... transparent to users.. how will that happen and the tags will still be meaningful to the business?  To do that it seems to me that the device/network will need to make assumptions about the appropriate tags for all of a users data?  From my experience users will create and process documents at a variety of sensitivities and classifications in a given day, and the only person who understands the significance of their documents is the user themselves.</p>

ok I think that Rob and I will need to agree to disagree about this. I think that I've been talking at cross-purposes with him a bit initially here but I will say that I probably still don't agree with him.<br />
The idea of data classification is a great one, in theory, but I've just not seen companies be able to implement and manage it at all well.  The main problem is the support of products.  That's got to be in place before you can begin to classify your data properly (in my opinion) and unless it's an industry standard in the early days it can't work as you'll not be able to apply it across all information repositories, at which point you've got holes in the protection provided.<br />
In addition to support of products is user buy-in.  What's the selling point to an end-user department in a corporate for the additional overhead for them to classify all their documents?<br />
On the point that Rob makes, about DRM not being involved in data centric security.  Well, sounds like my misunderstanding.  From reading the Jericho stuff which mentions DRM in it's "commandments" about data-centric security and Hoff mentioned it in his oringial post, so I obviously got the wrong end of the stick, although without DRM I'm kinda curious about how you stop a system which either doesn't understand your classification or deliberately tries to bypass it from reading data to which it's not entitled...<br />
To close on this a couple of experiences I've had with Data classification and marking.  I wrote some policies for a UK corporate on this a couple of years back and I remember going round the table and everyone adding stuff in about double-enveloping and all that other good information marking stuff, and just hitting intractable problems about things like how you classify data on things like E-Mail and MS Word which realistically everyone uses and also realising that to make this work is to ask a lot from a load of users who don't and don't want to understand anything about security.  Now maybe products will come along which make this all really easy and transparent to the users but, well I remain to be convinced...</p>
