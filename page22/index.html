    <p><a title="- VMTN Virtual Appliances Directory" href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/">- VMTN Virtual Appliances Directory</a><br />
The vmware virtual appliances directory looks very very cool to me.  It's a collection of pre-installed pre-configured virtual machines setup for specific purposes... need a media-wiki server... no problem... need a network security scannng server ... no problem...<br />
just download and go...<br />
And if you combine it with the release of vmware server FOR FREE then you really have something cool...<br />
One thing I did notice is that, unsurprisingly, all the VM's I looked at are based on Linux, and I expect this kind of thing will really drive the takeup of linux.  If you think about it.. you're asked to demo a say e-mail security server to handle your burgeoning Virus/SPAM problems...<br />
you could pay for a windows server license, buy it, configure it, get some software to do the filtering, install it, configure it, etc etc<br />
or you could download a pre-configured Linux VM using Pre-configured Open source software ...<br />
If you were a small overworked IT department... which would you choose?</p>

Post about a MITM attack on Citibanks two-factor authentication system.  The relaying of error messages from Citi by the attacker is a nice touch as it makes it seem a lot more legitimate...<br />
Well not really a surprise that the attackers have worked this out.  Of course it's slightly easier to detect/shut down as they have to do the attack in real-time as opposed to gathering the credentials and then using them at their leisure, which can happen with standard phishing.<br />
Still, goes to show that there's more work neeeded to be done on this.</p>

Another story in a long line of articles about sensitive data being lost by organisations who should know better.  This time it's the turn of the Australian High-Tec crime unit.<br />
One thing I've noticed about these stories is that the organisations involved almost always blame the employee involved for "breaking the rules"<br />
I think this is pretty disingenous(sp?) really.  The organisation needs to provide methods/procedures/tools for it's staff to move data around in a secure fashion in the manners in which they need to before they can blame individual staff members for data losses and I don't think that it's likely that most  companies will do that.<br />
So that means if you need people to take data with them from one country to another, you have to provide file encryption software (or better still device encryption software).  If data keys are the best way of doing this (and they usually are) then companies should be providing encrypted data keys to staff.<br />
Otherwise what happens is that people break rules because they have no way of getting their job done whilst staying within them.<br />
Now I may be off base and maybe all these companies have easy-to-use pervasive support for data encryption and the indiviudals involved were all just willfully negligent people who were willing to risk their jobs by deliberately avoiding all the controls their organisations had put in place.......</p>

    <p><a title="Ajax security basics" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1868?ref=rss">Ajax security basics</a><br />
Interesting article on Security Focus looking at the security implications of AJAX technologies and also the implications for Penetration testing AJAX enabled applications.<br />
In terms of the security risks of AJAX it will be interesting to see how well frameworks like Atlas and RoR take care of this for the developer.  One thing I noticed in testing .NET v2 applications was the in-built input validation really cuts down on XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities, instead of the "old days" with classic ASP where I could virtually guarantee some kind of input validation problem somewhere...</p>

Seems to be tool-tastic at the moment.  Foundstone have updated their hacme books and hacme bank site and released hacme travel and shipping!<br />
Shipping is a Coldfusion app with a mysql database and travel is in C++ which should be interesting... (like the typo on the travel page which explains that the system suffers from common vulnerabilities such as "SQL injection and <i>bugger</i> overflows")</p>
