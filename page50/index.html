  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Over at <a href="http://www.securitynews.net/spoof/index.html"> Securitynews.net </a> they've got a cool example of using graphical elements to create the illusion of a secure site...  Of course if you're not running IE on windows XP it just looks odd.<br />
Although with enough work that might be possible to overcome, by detecting the user agent requesting the page and presenting a suitable fake UI experience.... (of course you could always foil them by using Lynx ;op)</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/27/spam_appliances/">Spam appliances better than software?</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I'm definately with Joat  on this one.<a title="joatBlog: Appliances are better?" href="http://users.757.org/~joat/blog/archives/002132.html">joatBlog: Appliances are better?</a><br />
The article over at nwfusion.com presents the argument that spam management appliances are better than a software on general purpose OS.  Sure there are advantages in that you don't have another server to manage all the software on, but from a security point of view I'm dubious as to whether they are superior.<br />
One reason is that you're dependant on the vendor for patches for any operating system level attacks that come out, as these appliances are usually based on commodity operating systems customised for the task.<br />
Also it becomes difficult to know whether you have any machines with a specific vulnerability as you will probably not know what software the vendor has loaded on the appliance...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/27/cool_bootable_u/">cool.. bootable USB drives</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>Over here, at <a title="joatBlog: USB security" href="http://users.757.org/~joat/blog/archives/002133.html">joatBlog: USB security</a> is a pointer to some information about booktable USB drives....<br />
I'm really in two minds with regards to bootable USB drives, on the one hand they're an immensly useful means of transferrring ever larger quantities of data.<br />
But, from an IT Security point of view they're a danger, both from an information leakage aspect and also, with bootable drives, they present the possibility of someone coming to an enterprise and booting an environment to allow them to attack the network....<br />
Now I know, at this point people will be saying "well they're no different than bootable CD's" as you can get some nice bootable security focused Linux distros (like the one over at  <a href="http://www.localareasecurity.com/"> Local Area Security</a>, which in the wrong hands could be quite dangerous.  However many corporates will deploy desktop PC's without CD drives, however you can't deploy a PC these days without USB ports.<br />
It definately will lead to the point where some companies deicde to disable USB all together, or if possible, only the USB mass storage functionality.  When that happens I forsee some ..... interesting.... discussions because as I mentioned, they are very useful devices....</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/23/root_cause_analysis/">Root Cause Analysis in penetration testing</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>One thing I've noticed when the subject of penetration testing is raised is that commonly the goal is seen as being finding a vulnerability in a system and expoliting it.  This is seen as a successful penetration test.<br />
But, the question I think really is, why was that vulnerability there in the first place?  Say for example that a penetration test finds that a web server has default scripts left on it.  The main value of that finding is discovering why that was the case, was it because the default build for the company has that vulnerability, was the server that was tested built manually as a one-off..... The main benefit for the company is in realising where it's procedures or policies need amended to make sure that the vulnerability does not occur again rather than a report which says "yep that server was vulnerable"...</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/22/good_presentati/">Good presentation on Password Strength</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I came across an interesting article on <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/pki/twg/y2003/presentations/twg-03-05.pdf"> nist.gov </a> which goes into some details on the strength of various passwords in bits of entropy per character, amongst other things.  One point that interested me was that in most of the projections the marginal gain in entropy decreased as the password length increased, so going from say 4 characters to 5 characters would gain you more entropy than going from 29 to 30.<br />
Of course that assumes you're not using totally random strings for passwords, but then who does that (apart from people with extremely good memories of course....!)</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/22/analogies_in_th/">Analogies in the Security World</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>one thing that occurred to me recently when reading a security mailing list is the extent to which analogies to the physical world tend to be drawn as soon as the subject of computer crime starts being discussed.  For example whenever a discussion of the legality of port scanning starts you can generally expect to see people starting to compare it to "rattling the doors on a house".<br />
It seems to me that this is a good indication of the lack of laws regarding Internet/computer crime, as people can't definitively say whether something is or is not illegal so they are forced to draw analogies, which are unlikely to ever be 100% accurate.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/blog/2004/03/21/ssl_phishing_ar/">SSL phishing Article</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I read an interesting article on phishing last week over at <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/03/08/ssls_credibility_as_phishing_defense_is_tested.html">netcraft</a> which seems to show that it is possible for a phisher to create a SSL session and display the familiar padlock item, without having a valid certificate..... However I've since seen some disagreement about whether the "plain text" SSL method would work in that way, one of them is <a href="http://www.rtfm.com/movabletype/archives/2004_03.html#000792"> at rtfm.com </a>.<br />
So it remains to be seen if this is actually a problem. If it is it will be a blow to a lot of the advice handed out by banks on this subject, as it's usually accepted that the best way of telling whether you are at the correct site is to examine the certificate<br />
However, whilst it may be the best way in a browser situation I am not sure it is a good way.  It relies on users to understand to a limited extent domain names, so as to realise that a certificate issues to www.mybank.com is NOT the same as one issued to www.my-bank.com which is a pretty hard point to get across to non-technical users.<br />
There are ways however that banks and other institutions can make this kind of attack more difficult to execute.  One option is to use a two-stage login procedure and provide feedback after the first page which if the user doesn't see they would know that something was not right.<br />
So for example the bank asks for login name/password.  Once the user enters that he gets a screen saying something like "welcome back Mr Jones, the first line of your address is 1 Acacia Avenue" and asks for a second authenticator. ..</p>
