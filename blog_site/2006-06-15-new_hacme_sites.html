Seems to be tool-tastic at the moment.  Foundstone have updated their hacme books and hacme bank site and released hacme travel and shipping!<br />
Shipping is a Coldfusion app with a mysql database and travel is in C++ which should be interesting... (like the typo on the travel page which explains that the system suffers from common vulnerabilities such as "SQL injection and <i>bugger</i> overflows")</p>
