<p>Well it's taken far longer than it should have to get this up and running again, but I've had some issues getting everything setup at the new house (and indeed this is still running through a bit of a hack, using Dynamic DNS, some redirection and some port forwarding.....<br />
but t'was getting annoying not having this here, so I thought it better to get it up and running in this way rather than wait for the complete solution, as a result the domain name's not the same as was, so it'll be a little while before it's all working properly....</p>
