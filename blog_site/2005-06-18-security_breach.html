Another to add to this years <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm">seemingly endless</a> stories of large companies sufferering losses of customer information, in this case CC info...<br />
What I'm very interested to see is what actual penalties/negative consequences affect the companies responsible for these breaches, as I think it will shape some of the internal debate in companies that handle this kind of data about appropriate levels of security.<br />
One thing that does seem to have happened is a loss of share price for choicepoint... looking at their stock graph their trading down about 20% from around the point when their breach was publisised....<br />
Actually maybe that's worth looking at (getting a list of the breaches from privacyrights and comparing stock prices before/after)</p>
