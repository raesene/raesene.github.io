Just started to go through the blackhat europe 2006 media archives and found something useful to keep a note of (expect many more posts as I go).<br />

This site seems to have a load of good links and an eBook on hacking iSeries .. Also here's a link to the blackhat presentation which has a lot of good info. on the topic <a> Hacking iSeries Presentation </a></p>
