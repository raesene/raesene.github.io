<p>well I think ive finally found the right handheld computer for me... A sharp Zaurus c860.  Its linux based, has lots of good security software available, can take SD and CF cards, has an excellent 640x480 display and isnt too bulky or heavy.<br />
also the keyboard is fairly good... as Im writing this entry using it.....</p>
