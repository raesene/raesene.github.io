<p>There's a link to a Interesting article over at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2004/11/18/266033.aspx">Michael Howards Blog</a><br />
He makes some very valid points about why running Windows machines as an administrator is a very bad idea(tm) unless absolutely required.<br />
Also there's information on a useful technique to reduce your privileges when running specific applications, aimed at providing a safer web browsing experience.</p>
