An article providing some more info on the Cisco code theft, over at Network World.  One point mentioned in it that I would disagree with though is the comment that<br />
"Unlike open source software products, the security of Cisco's systems, like those of other proprietary software vendors, depends on the source code being kept out of public view, he said"<br />
This is a bit on the sweeping side really...  Although it is a salutory lesson that companies shouldn't rely on the secrecy of their code to provide security.</p>
