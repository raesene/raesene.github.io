Here's an example of bad-guys using CSRF attacks try and extort money from domain name holders.  Interestingly it's the first example of practical use of this kind of attack I've seen.<br />
Although the vulnerability in GMail that seems to have been exploited is now fixed, I bet this won't be the last time we see this form of attack in use, and it does give an example of the kind of damage that a CSRF attack can cause...</p>
