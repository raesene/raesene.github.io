<p>An interesting blog entry on <a title="A Day in the Life of an Information Security Investigator: Locking Down The Obvious: USB" href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/security/investigator/archives/001904.asp"> Locking Down The Obvious: USB</a><br />
I think it's a point well made.  Essentially companies need to look at USB ports in the same way they look at CD-ROM's and floppy drives.  If CD's and floppies are locked down then USB ports should be as well... although it is more challenging technologically as USB ports have wider range of functionality than CD-Drives, which makes it more likely that they will need to be enabled.<br />
It also looks like software products are coming into the market to manage this kind of functionality where required.  For example <a href="http://www.reflex-magnetics.com"> Reflex disknet pro </a> looks like an interesting way of controlling access to removable media, including USB keys....</p>
