<p>Started putting stuff on here again after a long while off... have been busy doing things with Wireless networks and the like which I may get round to posting some time.<br />
I've also been trying my hand at website design.  After looking at many Content Management Systems and not really finding any that suited what I wanted (a quick simple site with content about a given subject, no forums, no news section, no logins...) I reverted to the fine art of the text editor, a book on HTML and CSS and some websites..<br />
At the end of it is a site about <a href="http://www.isobelellis.com"> Scottish Artist Isobel Ellis </a> (or the mother-in-law as she's also known!)</p>
