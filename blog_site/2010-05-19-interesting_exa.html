<p>One of the aspects of the move to cloud computing I find most interesting is the new and emergent risks that come with the move of services from a traditional networked IT environment, to being hosted "out in the open" of the cloud.<br />
Whilst attention gets paid to some of the technical risks, I don't think there's been a lot of focus on some of the more procedural/human aspects of it.<br />
One example is the visibility/effect of configuration mistakes.  In a traditional IT environment, mistakes can be partially contained by the network perimeter (albeit that containment is usually weaker than it used to be).<br />
If someone makes an access control change which allows anonymous access to data, that mistake is likely only to be exploitable and visible to a limited group of people.<br />
With the move to Cloud computing though, that same mistake could be instantly visible to the whole world and all it's attacker communities.<br />
A really good example of this comes up in a vulnerability found by Jonathan Siegel (background story <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/03/user-ignorance-causes-cloud-security-leak-accounts-passwords-revealed.php">here</a> and <a href="http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/cloud-consultant-wants-amazon-web-services-revamp/140391">here</a>).<br />
In essence the problem seems to be that users of Amazon Web Services have made access control errors which set disk snapshots to be publicly available to everyone in a given region, and in the examples Jonathan gives this has included a database of user accounts for a web service and a full copy of a news services' web site.<br />
So what would have likely been a relatively minor access control issue in an Internal network setup, becomes a situation where all the data in question should be considered compromised.</p>
