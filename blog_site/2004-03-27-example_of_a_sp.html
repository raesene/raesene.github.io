<p>Over at <a href="http://www.securitynews.net/spoof/index.html"> Securitynews.net </a> they've got a cool example of using graphical elements to create the illusion of a secure site...  Of course if you're not running IE on windows XP it just looks odd.<br />
Although with enough work that might be possible to overcome, by detecting the user agent requesting the page and presenting a suitable fake UI experience.... (of course you could always foil them by using Lynx ;op)</p>
