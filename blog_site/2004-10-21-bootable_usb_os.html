<p>Theres's a story over at <a title="Slashdot | Secure, Portable, Virtual Privacy Machine" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/21/176235">Slashdot</a>, covering the idea of a bootable USB based operating environment based on <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/"> Damn Small Linux </a><br />
I could see this kind of thing as quite handy if you wanted to use cybercafe's or other untrusted computers, without the risk of, software, spyware.  Of course whether the cybercafe owners would be too happy with you booting one of their PC's of a USB memory stick is another matter.....</p>
