Some interesting comment on BP's new deperimeterisation moves (more information <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/security/0,39020375,39253439,00.htm"> here </a>)<br />
I'd agree with the sentiments expressed in TaoSecurity, I agree with the Jericho Forums position that every device should be able to stand on its own from a security perspective, however the idea of deliberately weakening the security afforded to laptops by connecting them directly to the Internet when they're on the Corporate LAN seems like a very bad plan, as it reduces the numbers of layers of protection afforded to them needlessly.<br />
Also it renders the security of the laptops very brittle, so if for example there is a problem with a change deployed to these devices which leaves them vulnerable to an attack, they won't have the safety net of being behind a corporate firewall to allow the IT team time to fix the problem before it has an impact...<br />
I've also been thinking, how is this going to work in practice?  If the laptops are on the Internet, surely they'll need to connect to Corporate IT assets, so they'll need a VPN tunnel into the company.  Also surely BP will still want to take advantage of centralised web site monitoring, Email Anti-Virus etc... So all the traffic from these laptops sitting in corporate offices will go through a VPN tunnel back into the corporate LAN then potentially back out onto the internet.... Surely that's not a great plan from a cost perspective..</p>
