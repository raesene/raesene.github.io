Story discussing a new advertising technique whereby content is transmitted directly to bluetooth phones, and pointing out the risks of getting users in the habit of accepting content beamed to them.<br />
The comments from the company making the advertising mechanism are interesting.  They seem to be saying it's ok because their campaigns only contain music and video and not applications, and that users should never install unrecognised applications...<br />
To me this seems either a bit naive.  If you look at the PC market, you see exploits where malicious code pretending to be music or video files can be executed due to vulnerabilities in media players.  Also you're relying on users to be able to tell the difference, and spyware makers have proven very good at getting people to believe that their content is not an "unrecognised application" in order to get installed....</p>
