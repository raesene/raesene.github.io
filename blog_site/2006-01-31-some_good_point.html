An interesting posting on a somewhat neglected area of risk to client machines.<br />
The point that potentially exploitable 3rd party Active X controls will be installed on many, if not all client PC's is a good one.<br />
I've seen companies that more or less successfully patch browsers and audit client software,  but I'm not aware of any that track Active X component versions...<br />
Sounds like a good reason to lock down Active X installations on Corporate Clients..</p>
