Here's one solution to a problem I'm having at the moment where I'm trying to install the ruby mysql plugin on a CentOS machine.<br />
another note is that in order to get rails working you need to get the ruby 1.8.4 packages from the c4-testing repository <a href="http://dev.centos.org/centos/4/testing/"> here </a><br />
<b>[update]</b> Actually ended up using this solution http://mopyblue.blogspot.com/2006/04/ruby-on-rail-fc4.html which works for me...</p>
