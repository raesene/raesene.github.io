<p>There's a new freeware database security scanner available called <a href="http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/scuba/">scuba </a> from Imperva.<br />
The front page looks quite interesting so I'll be sure to have a look at it.  However not today, as I'm not in fromt of a windows machine.<br />
And here's the really weird bit.  When I heard about it I noted that it's a Java program..... "great" I thought it'll run nicely on Linux (which I use almost exclusively at home, apart from the odd game) but.. it's a java program that requires windows!!<br />
What the heck is the point of that!<br />
"No problem" I thought "I'll just download the archive and there'll be a JAR file there that I can run manually"....<br />
no<br />
when you download the program it extracts one .exe file!<br />
Why bother programming something in Java if you're going to tie it to windows!!</p>
