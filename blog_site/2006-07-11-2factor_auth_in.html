Post about a MITM attack on Citibanks two-factor authentication system.  The relaying of error messages from Citi by the attacker is a nice touch as it makes it seem a lot more legitimate...<br />
Well not really a surprise that the attackers have worked this out.  Of course it's slightly easier to detect/shut down as they have to do the attack in real-time as opposed to gathering the credentials and then using them at their leisure, which can happen with standard phishing.<br />
Still, goes to show that there's more work neeeded to be done on this.</p>
