Very good points made in this post.  At the moment the probablw saviour for a lot of transactional sites is that they've been really slow on the bandwagon, so are still running web 1.0 style sites!<br />
That said, the more information that comes out from researchers like <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/">Jeremiah Grossman </a>and <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/">RSnake</a> the less faith people can really have in the browser security model that most E-Commerce sites rely on.<br />
What's been missing to date is the Slammer or Nimda of the web application hacking world.  Without a wide-ranging attack like that, it will continue to be very difficult to convince a lot of businesses to take these threats seriously...</p>
