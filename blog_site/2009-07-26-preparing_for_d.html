<p>So I'm off to <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-17/dc-17-index.html"> Defcon </a>and <a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/BSidesLasVegas">security BSides</a> next week, and I thought a couple of precautions were in order before I go...<br />
1. Tunnel all traffic through SSH to a trusted host, instructions <a href="http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/weblogs/azul/firefox-ssh-tunnel">here</a><br />
2. Set iptables up to explicitly deny any traffic not travelling through the tunnel<br />
3. Turn off any vaguely network related features on my iPhone!</p>
