<p>After reading a post by Gursev Kalra <a href="http://gursevkalra.blogspot.com/2009/09/ruby-and-openssl-based-ssl-cipher.html">here</a>, I decided to have a shot at putting together a slightly expanded version of his ssl Cipher suite checking code in ruby.<br />
I've got it working reasonably well in my tests and it can chuck out reports in text and XML .  The code for the main script and a Metasploit module which does the same is <a href="http://wiki.mccune.org.uk/index.php/RubySSLChecker"> here</a>.  Any feedback/suggestions welcome :)</p>
