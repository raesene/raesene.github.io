<p>I was pointed to this interesting sourceforge project by another Rory... <a title="asleap home page" href="http://asleap.sourceforge.net/">asleap home page</a><br />
It's a piece of software which exposes the weaknesses in Cisco's LEAP protocol....  This is the second thing I've seen recently regarding lack of security in Ciscos products recently... odd for a vendor with a relatively good reputation for security...</p>
