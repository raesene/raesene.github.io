<p>So I've been playing a bit with Metasploit over the holiday weekend (hey what are days off for..), and as usual when researching stuff, I've come across a load of links I don't want to lose track of, so I'll put them up here, may be useful to someone else as well..<br />
I'll refrain from the really obvious linking to the project homepage, as if you're looking for metasploit links, I'd guess you've found it already :)<br />
