This is a pretty nasty vulnerability for someone like Cisco to have, as you'd have thought that their development process would have noticed this kind of mistake.  Also given that WLSE is a piece of security software, in that it monitors for rogue AP's amongst other things it is suprising that this got through.<br />
I think that the only saving grace of this is that the kind of equipment it occured in, will probably be managed by networking professionals who will check for security advisories....</p>
