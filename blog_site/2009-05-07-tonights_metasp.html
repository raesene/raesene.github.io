<p>Been taking a look at another one of the newer Metasploit features tonight.  WMAP is looking to integrate web application scanning functionality into Metasploit.  There's a couple of good overviews <a href="http://trac.metasploit.com/browser/framework3/trunk/documentation/wmap.txt">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/wmap_meta.htm">Here</a>  and <a href="http://darkoperator.blogspot.com/2008/10/metasploit-wmap-web-attack-and.html">Here</a><br />
Getting it up and running is a little bit finicky at the moment, as you need to used a patched copy of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">ratproxy</a> to collect the base URLs for the scanner (quick note is that my fairly new Ubuntu Intrepid install was missing libssl-dev which is a pre-requisite for compiling ratproxy so worth checking for if you get make errors when setting it up).<br />
Once you've gathered URLs and fed them in to the database getting the scanner to start running is straightforward (examples in the links at the top so I won't go into it).  From an initial look, some of the plugins seem to do some directory/file brute-forcing which can take ages to run, but if it's going on too long you can use CTRL-C to interrupt just that plug-in and Metasploit will catch the interrupt gracefully and move on to the next directory or plugin...</p>
