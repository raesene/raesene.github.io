<p>I came across an interesting site called <a href="http://www.linux-forensics.com/">Linux-Forensics.com</a>.  It's a good resource dedicated to the use of Linux in computer forensics<br />
Whilst in general I like the idea of using Linux in alot of places, it'll have a uphill struggle in this area, I think, up against the likes of <a href="http://www.encase.com">Encase </a>.  One reason for this is that, at least in the UK, Encase is recognised by the police and the courts as being a reliable forensic tool, the evidence from which can be admissable in court.  So it would be a brave forensic investigator who used something else, which he would doubtless have more trouble justifying in court.<br />
That said not every forensic analysis ends up in court and encase is a tad on the pricy side.....</p>
