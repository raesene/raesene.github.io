well not really, just growing more slowly.... But it's an interesting story all the same. It seems that, surprise surprise, Internet users are getting tired of all the phishing and spyware and viruses, and some are stopping useing the 'net for shopping and banking.<br />
I actually think that this could become and accellerating trend.  I don't see any magic bullets to make things easier for ordinary, non-technical, Internet users and without some sort of change more and more people will give up on using the 'net for e-commerce no matter how convenient it is.<br />
The annoying thing is that this will hit all the banks and many retailers in the pocket, but because it's no one companies problem, none of them seem to be stepping up to take a lead in trying to combat this...</p>
