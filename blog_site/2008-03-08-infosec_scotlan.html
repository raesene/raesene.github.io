<p>There's a new portal over at www.infosec-scotland.com thats been started up to provide information about upcoming security events in Scotland (and the wider UK).  There's a calendar of events available and some links to relevant sites.<br />
If you've got any events you'd like to get added to the calendar, just send an email over to Events@Infosec-Scotland.com</p>
