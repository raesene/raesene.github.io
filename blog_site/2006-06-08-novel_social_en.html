I like the idea of the trojan USB keys that the pen testing firm came up with.<br />
given the level of success they had with this, I'd guess it won't be too long before someone who's not one of the good guys tries this as a technique...<br />
This is another good reason to lock down USB ports on corporate machines!</p>
