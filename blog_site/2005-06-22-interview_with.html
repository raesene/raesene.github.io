There's a great interview with Marcus Ranum over at Securityfocus.  It's obvious from the responses that he's been around in network security for a while and knows what's what..<br />
Also there's a couple of great quotes...<br />
in response to "<em>If a standard protocol is broken or insecure, what is the best solution? Maybe supporting only some features or adding a crypto layer?</em>"<br />
<strong>If it's broken, adding crypto just makes it broken and hidden. </strong> is a classic...<br />
also there's some interesting thoughts on de-perimeterisation and advocacy of data-level protection as the solution to all evils</p>
