<p>Now I'll start this post with the obligatory IANAL, but there's a story over at Security pipeline, which seems to be saying that <a href="http://nwc.securitypipeline.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=22100927"> Security Managers Could Face Court Penalties</a> for poor security or for making lists of top measures that companies should follow and then not implementing them all...<br />
I've got to say that the examples sound a bit over dramatised to me, but it's an interesting theory from the point of view of convincing management of the importance of being seen to be proactive in the field of InfoSec...</p>
