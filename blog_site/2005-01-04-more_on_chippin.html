<p>there's some more comment on the ongoing Chip &amp; PIN implementation in the UK at <a title="Schneier on Security: Easy-to-Remember PINs" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/01/easytoremember_1.html">Schneier on Security </a> and <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000291.html"> Financial Cryptography </a>, with some interesting points being made about how this move co-incides with one to shift the liability for fraudulent transactions from banks to retailers where the terminals haven't been upgraded.<br />
Interesting to note that I've recently received a credit card with an expiry in 2006 which doesn't have a chip on it... I wonder if retailers will start refusing to accept cards without chip&amp;PIN in order to avoid liability.</p>
