<p>One of the cool things about rails is the Scriptalicious javascript library which you get as part of rails.  I've just been trying to add in place editing to some of the fields in my app and I encountered a problem with way it's implemented in conjunction with the way I was decribing the view.<br />
Anyway a much better description of the exact problem I was having and a solution (which is in the comments to the post) is at the <a href="http://www.rabbitcreative.com/articles/2006/04/04/ruby-on-rails-in-place-editing">Rabiit Creative Blog </a></p>
