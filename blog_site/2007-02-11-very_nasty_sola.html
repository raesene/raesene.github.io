<p>There's some information on a very nasty Solaris telnet vulnerability over at the <a href="http://www.computerdefense.org/?p=258"> Computer Defense blog</a>.<br />
Now hopefully this'll have limited impact 'cause all the solaris admins out there are running SSH already...<br />
Doubt it though, I've heard quite a few unix/router guys argue against dropping telnet in the past, so there's probably quite a few boxes out there using it...</p>
