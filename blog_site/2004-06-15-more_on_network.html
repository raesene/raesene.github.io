<p>Here's another article around the idea of policy enforcement, this time on <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2004/0614switchsecurity.html?fsrc=rss-security">Switches</a>.<br />
As I said <a href="http://www.nmrcon.net/archives/000060.html"> previously </a> I think that this is the right way to go about it.  If it is possible to block a machine from getting on the network if it doesn't meet certain criteria, then it would be possible not only to reduce the incidence of virii/worms in corporate networks, it might also provide some defence from non-corporate machines being placed on the network.</p>
