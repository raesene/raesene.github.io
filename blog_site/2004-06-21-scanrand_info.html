<p>A interesting article at LURHQ presents - <a title="Scanrand Dissected - LURHQ" href="http://www.lurhq.com/scanrand.html">Scanrand Dissected</a>.  It's a great explanation of how scanrand works and also a speed comparison between it and nmap, although the author does point out that nmap has far more functionality than scanrand....<br />
Looks like a great tool for quickly scanning networks for rogue servers....</p>
