<p>Just had the first day of the <a href="http://www.scottishrubyconference.com">Scottish Ruby Conference</a>.  The venue was awesome, there'll doubtless be lots of good pictures up on places like flickr in due course, but here's a couple I snapped with my Nokia n900. The three track rooms were the <a href="http://www.mccune.org.uk/presentations/src_conference_hall.png">Conference Hall</a>, the <a href="http://www.mccune.org.uk/presentations/src_great_hall.png">Great Hall</a> and my personal favourite <a href="http://www.mccune.org.uk/presentations/src_new_library"> the "new" library</a>.<br />
The talks were interesting as always, personal highlight for me had to be Jim Weirich managing to go from particle physics to functional programming seamlessly in a single talk!<br />
my talk was on breaking things with ruby and was a pretty quick look at the world of penetration testing and some of the cool projects (primarily Metasploit) which use ruby in this area. My slides can be found <a href="http://www.mccune.org.uk/presentations/breaking-things-with-ruby.pdf">here</a> and if people are interested in more information on the topics I covered here's some good linkage to start with.<br />
<strong><big>Metasploit</big></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.metasploit.com">The Main Metasploit Website</a> . This is the best place to start.  There's also a wiki and source code repository on their redmine site <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/">here</a><br />
<a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/">Metasploit Unleashed</a>. This is a free training course from Offensive Security which offers a good place to start with Metasploit, and covers a lot more ground than I could today.<br />
Blog-wise there's a couple of places I consistently find good information on Metasploit.  <a href="http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/">Carnal0wnage's blog</a> and the <a href="http://www.darkoperator.com/">Dark Operator</a> blogs have lots of posts on what can be done with Metasploit, as well as the <a href="http://blog.metasploit.com/">Official Metasploit Blog</a> of course.<br />
Also on twitter following <a href="http://twitter.com/hdmoore">@hdmoore</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/carnal0wnage">@carnal0wnage</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/egyp7">@egyp7</a> is a good place to start.<br />
Lastly if anyone's looking for videos demonstrating Metasploit, there's quite a few on <a href="http://www.securitytube.net">Security Tube</a> amongst other places.</p>
