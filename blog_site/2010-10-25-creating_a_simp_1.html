<p>This just puts together the body of the note description for each finding, as one long string.<br />
There's obviously a lot more that could be done with this (like better error handling and writing tests) but with those files complete, the module should work ok and you should be able to import vulns from your database directly into Dradis using the "import note" feature.<br />
I've put a copy of the code for the plugin up <a href="http://www.mccune.org.uk/code/simple_vulndb_import.tar.bz2">here</a>, in case it's helpful :)</p>
