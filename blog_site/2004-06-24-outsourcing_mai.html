<p>In an article over at Yahoo we're told <a title="Yahoo! News - Mail Security Service Model Marches On" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1738&amp;ncid=1208&amp;e=1&amp;u=/zd/20040624/tc_zd/130172"> Mail Security Service Model Marches On</a>.  Its interesting as there definately is an interesting proposition on outsourcing things like management of e-mail security.  However I must say, I'd not be too comfortable outsourcing something as critical as e-mail without some very good assurances and SLA's surrounding it.<br />
for example I'd hate to be the e-mail admin who has to troubleshoot their mail delivery when I didn't control the whole path for the mail out to the recipient, especially if there's a possibility of false positives as there is with many e-mail spam/virus management packages.....</p>
