<p>I just configured the preview version of Windows Azure Backup.  It is very nice looking and easy to use once you get it up and running - but the instructions to install it are difficult to find and a bit patchy.</p>
<p>First you have to create a certificate for your vault.  You use a utility called makecert.exe which is part of the Windows SDK (the link in the documentation to TechNet doesn't work - so you can get it here.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/aa904949">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/aa904949</a></p>
<p>For reasons that are not clear to me the utility doesn't seem to be available as a standalone - but downloading just the tools part of the SDK contains it.</p>
<p>Then the documentation that actually works is here (there are several wrong versions in different places dotted across their sites).</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn169036.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn169036.aspx</a></p>
<p>The key thing is to follow the instructions exactly - you need <strong>both </strong>the .cer file and the .pfx file (the public and private keys).</p>
<p>Once you have followed all the instructions and configured your vault you can go ahead with the local software install.  If you have had the Beta version of the agent installed, you need to uninstall it and then install the new one.  Once the software is installed and the agent started, you can then register your server - this took a few minutes to do on my machine - so be patient with it.</p>
<p>Once all this is done - configuring your backup and restores is a snip.  I hope that when it comes out of preview the documentation is improved a bit.</p>
