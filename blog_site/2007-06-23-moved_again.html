<p>I've had the blog running in a virtual machine for a while since the power supply on my server blew, but that's it back onto dedicated hardware now..<br />
In fact it's a nice little debian server using a Buffalo Linkstation Pro reflashed with <a href="http://linkstationwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page">FreeLink</a>.<br />
Pretty good deal as you get a perfectly good linux server based on a 130 pound piece of hardware.  I've got two of them running now, one as a web server and one as a file/print server.  There a lot smaller an quieter than running full-tower cases in the office!</p>
