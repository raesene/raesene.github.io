Looks like a new version of my rails IDE of choice is out.<br />
I'm not usually a great fan of IDE's for development, but I must admit that I'm liking working in radrails quite a lot.<br />
There's several fetures which I like, the subversion integration is cool (I only discovered this by mistake, but still...) and having the generators in the IDE is also very handy.  Another small, but useful feature is the server support where it'll recognise that you've got multiple apps in your workspace and start them on separate ports...</p>
