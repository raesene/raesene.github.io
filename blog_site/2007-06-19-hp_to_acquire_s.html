Well that's SPI getting acquired now by HP to follow on from <a href="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/12776/53/">IBM buying Watchfire</a><br />
There may be loads of companies left in the security community waiting to get bought up, but there's only really Cenzic left of the original top 4 web application scanning tools left, and some other up-and-coming scanners like Acunetix WVS maybe as well.</p>
