An interesting post over at financial crpytography looks at the practical implications of a recent paper on collisions in MD5 and possible effects on the security of certificates.<br />
I'd agree that the paper has been taken out of context in a lot of stories, but then that seems to happen a lot when the journalists covering something aren't maybe experts in that field, also I suppose there must be a temptation for the researchers to talk up their findings...</p>
