An interesting post on Dana Epp's blog talking about running as least privilege (or in this example not) in Windows (also you can read the odd comments from someone I can only assume was trolling ?!)<br />
It's real nice to see that the windows world is moving more towards the UNIX paradigm of not running as root unless you have to.  I hope this will have a positive effect for end users too... Less of the frustration when being told that you have to be an administrator to install a media player !!! (apple quicktime in this example) would be nice....</p>
