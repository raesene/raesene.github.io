There's a good guide to how Cross site Scripting attacks occur and some of the ways to defend against them over at secguru.<br />
One thing I'd add, is that if you're working in a Microsoft world, using ASP.NET is a very good idea as the default config. seems to make XSS a lot harder to execute (can't remember the exact settings at the moment, ust remembering my frustration last time I had to test an asp.net site...)</p>
