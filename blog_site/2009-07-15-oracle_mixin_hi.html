<p>The oracle mix-in is now in metasploit trunk so should be a snap to get working.  Installation instructions are up <a href="https://metasploit.com/trac/wiki/OracleUsage">here</a>.<br />
Especially note the requirements for specific versions of the dbi and oci8 gems, later versions don't always work as expected with some of the oracle exploit plugins.</p>
