<p>Not really security related at all, but I thought I'd post about a really cool media player I've been using recently on Linux... <a href="http://amarok.kde.org"> Amarok </a> has many cool features, but the ones I like best are..<br />
- Catalogues all your songs reading all the tags and sorting by artist<br />
- Cover manager, automatically grabs the covers for the CD's from amazon<br />
- Nice statistics down the left side with things like "other albums by this artist" and "most popular song"<br />
- looks really nice...</p>
