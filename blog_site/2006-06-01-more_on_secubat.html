<p>Looks like there is a alpha release of SecuBat available  <a href="http://www.secubat.org/Download.aspx"> here </a>.<br />
if (like me) your Austrian's not so hot, there's some more information in english <a href="http://www.seclab.tuwien.ac.at/projects/secubat/"> here </a><br />
It'll be interesting to line this up with Oedipus and see what their vulnerability finding strengths and weaknesses are...</p>
