Interesting article on Security Focus looking at the security implications of AJAX technologies and also the implications for Penetration testing AJAX enabled applications.<br />

One thing I noticed in testing .NET v2 applications was the in-built input validation really cuts down on XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities, instead of the "old days" with classic ASP where I could virtually guarantee some kind of input validation problem somewhere...</p>
