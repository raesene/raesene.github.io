<p>Well no sooner than I blog about the problems falgged up by Kevin Clark's post on changes to the recommended styles for rails code, but someone comes up with an idea for <a title="Deprecated Plugin -- Find Old Rails Code | Ruby on Rails for Newbies" href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/08/31/deprecated-plugin-find-old-rails-code"> Finding Old Rails Code</a><br />
Although it could be controversial if some of the findings are more of preferred style than deprecated features it's still one way of dealing with the issue.<br />
Also helps me out 'cause I was going to go through the 2 little rails sites I've written to help me get up to speed with rails and looks for deprecated items.<br />
One thing all this has helped me with is that I did find it confusing that different tutorials had slightly different ways of doing the same thing.<br />
In particular the problem of where to use :symbols and where to use single or double quoted text...<br />
still reckon this kind of rapid change is likely to put off some newbies if they, like me, start with tutorials and see many differing styles being used.<br />
Actually one thing that occurs is this kind of issue will be interesting for the burgeoning rails book market, in that it's real difficult for a paper book to keep up with rapid change in the material it's covering....</p>
