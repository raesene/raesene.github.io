<p>Over at the <a title="New Scientist" href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994858">New Scientist</a> there's an interesting note for an attack on a mail server.<br />
I always find attacke like this interesting asa they're essentially a case of mis-use of a protocol.  Also given that tthe return of undeliverable e-mail is usually taken as a given on the Internet and it becomes unlikely that this kind of DoS attack will be going away anytime soon.</p>
