<p>Looks like there are a couple of very interesting new books out if you're interested in software security...<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764544683/qid%3D1079640871/026-5290742-7578828">The Shellcoder's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes</a><br />
and<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201786958/qid=1079640958/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_9_1/026-5290742-7578828">Exploiting Software: How to Break Code</a><br />
I wonder if this is the start of a trend along the lines of all the network security related books of the Hacking Exposed genre..<br />
One good thing that may come out about this, is hopefully it will lessen the number of times that the argument that "no-one in my company would know how to do this" is used with regards to application hacking stops people from spending on internal application security.<br />
Anyway, definately two for my bookshelf.</p>
