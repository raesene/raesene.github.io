An interesting entry over at Martin McKeay's blog covering the info. from the <a href="http://www.honeynet.org">Honeynet Project</a> about trends seen in compromise of systems on the Internet from their research..<br />
Looks like Linux systems are getting harder to compromise out of the box, while the time to compromise windows systems goes down..<br />
Hopefully the windows time will go up as more machines ship with SP2 on by default (thus giving the user enough time to get the patches, before they're compromised)</p>
