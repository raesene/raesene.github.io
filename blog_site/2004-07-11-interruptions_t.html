<p>The blog's been a bit erratic over the last couple of weeks as I've been out of town and we've had the odd power problem (good excuse for buying a UPS!!)<br />
Anyway I'm moving house this week so unless I get a chance to move the DNS temporarily and put the blog on a hosted site somewhere I'll be out for a couple more weeks while I get access set up at the new house........</p>
