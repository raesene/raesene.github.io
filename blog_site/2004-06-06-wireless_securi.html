<p>It definately looks like Wireless insecurity issues will be here to stay for the time being.  With 2 vulnerabilities in popular wifi products being announced <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/365069">here </a>and <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/11754/"> here </a>.<br />
The main problem with these types of vulnerabilities is that I don't think that they will be patched anytime soon in the majority of affected devices.  People are hardly waking up to the concept that software needs to be regularly patched, let alone the idea that hardware requires patches as well...  Also a lot of wifi products tend to be deployed in smaller organisations and homes, where there is, typically,  less security knowledge than in larger firms...<br />
Also a problem is as noted <a href="http://afr.com/articles/2004/05/31/1085855471324.html"> here</a> in a lot of cases you don't even need a vulnerability to hack into a wireless network as many vendors ship Access Points in a wide open config!</p>
