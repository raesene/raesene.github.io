One of those times when I start writing a comment on a post and end up rambling for so long that it ends up being worth a post...<br />
--<br />
I'll chime in on the OWASP needs some staff line.  I know they've got loads of great people running it but I reckon they could benefit from some people to focus on specific areas of OWASP.<br />
A good example.. the website.  Wikis are great for some types of site and information but personally I think that finding things on the current OWASP site is harder than it should be.<br />
The only way that I've found to tell what's happening on the site seems to be to look at the wiki recent changes list, which isn't a very user friendly experience.<br />
Also some of the great information that is on there is not well flagged up.  An example would be <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools">this page </a>  which has a really cool list of web app. security stuff but I only found it digging through the diffs, usually I wouldn't think to go into a specific chapter to find that.<br />
Another example, where I think a permanent staff member would be useful, is administering the SPOC projects and chivying the people assigned to them for updates.<br />
Right now it's rapidly turning into a summer/autumn of code not spring <b>;o)</b> . the status page that's gone up has all the projects at 0% complete !<br />
All In all I think OWASP are doing some great work, a lot of which may be less appreciated 'cause it's not as discoverable as it could be....</p>
