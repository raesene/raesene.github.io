<p>I've just started a new role as a director at <a href="http:///www.7elements.co.uk"> 7 Elements</a>.  We're providing technical security consultancy and penetration testing services, focusing on the scottish market.<br />
As part of that we've started up a blog <a href="http://blog.7elements.co.uk">here</a> to talk through some of the ideas we've got for approaching security and testing in a pragmatic way.<br />
I'm planning to keep this blog running for now (not that you could tell from the level of posts!), but more of my security/testing stuff will probably pop up on the 7 Elements blog...</p>
