<p>Looking at a couple of tools I found on the web <a title="CGIProxy-- HTTP/FTP Proxy in a CGI Script" href="http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/#intro">CGIProxy </a> and <a href="http://www.whitefyre.com/poxy/index.php?section=main">PHProxy</a> it seems to me that content based blocking by companies becomes a bit pointless, as you can put one of these scripts on a home PC on a DSL/cable modem connection and bypass anything which blocks based on URL, unless you use a "everything not explicitly allowed is denied" setup, which is kind of a hard sell in most companies.<br />
Additionally, if you access these over a SSL connection, any proxies or content checkers won't see anything apart from the original URL so content scanning wouldn't work either...<br />
Just goes to show, open one port on a firewall and be prepared for the fact that almost any content can come through....</p>
