<p>There's a post over at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/11/16/microsoft-sql-server-runs-the-security-table.aspx"> Michael Howards Blog</a> about a study showing that Microsoft SQL Server has a better security record than Oracle or MySQL.<br />
Whilst I agree with the overall point, SQL server (especially 2005) is waay better than Oracle/MySQL on the security front, the numbers this study uses seem odd..<br />
They've not specified product version and that's just going to  make the numbers very odd, they've also not (that I can see) specified their exact methodology the comment above implies that their methodology may not be the best!<br />
Here's a better (IMO) analysis, using secunia which actually breaks things down well by product<br />
Number of advisories per product from 2003-2006<br />
Microsoft SQL Server 2000 - 10<br />
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 - 0<br />
MySQL 3                   - 11<br />
MySQL 4                   - 19<br />
MySQL 5                   - 5<br />
Oracle 8i                 - 17<br />
Oracle 9i Enterprise      - 23<br />
Oracle 10g                - 13<br />
Now I know it's possible to argue the point around severity etc and product age, but I'd say still a pretty clear win for Microsoft...</p>
