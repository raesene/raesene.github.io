Well this isn't a good thing for security research in my opinion.  Whilst I don't always think that security companies getting press by releasing exploits is a good thing, it is one of the main ways that software companies seem to be put under pressure to improve the security of their software.<br />
Ideally companies would always be proactive about improving the security of their systems, but in the real world other things tend to take precedence, unless it's made a priority for them by external people, either security researchers pointing out flaws, or "black hats" exploiting their software...<br />
Arguably if Microsoft hadn't developed such a bad reputation for security a couple of years ago, we wouldn't have seen all the excellent initiative their producing now.....</p>
