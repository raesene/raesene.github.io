I'm not usually a great fan of the sue someone every time something goes wrong mentality that some people and companies seem to have but this one could actually be good for security...<br />
300 Banks suing TJX for the breach... If they win then I'd expect retailers to start taking security a fair bit more seriously as then there'll be some really serious consequences to losing control of your customers data...</p>
