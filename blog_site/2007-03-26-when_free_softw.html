<p>I've been looking at Oracle database security recently and one of the things I've come across has really surprised me.<br />
Oracle release a free (as in beer) version of their database product <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/index.html"> Oracle 10g XE </a><br />
To quote their product page<br />
<i>...Oracle Database XE is a great starter database for:<br />
* Developers working on PHP, Java, .NET, XML, and Open Source applications<br />
* DBAs who need a free, starter database for training and deployment<br />
* Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and hardware vendors who want a starter database to distribute free of charge<br />
* Educational institutions and students who need a free database for their curriculum<br />
</i><br />
Yeah apart from one small problem.  There are <b> No </b> security patches available for this product !<br />
So if you download and use this product in your open source application as described you're going to be left with a seriously insecure database given the number of vulnerabilities in Oracle 10GR2 which have been patched in the main product and not in this one.<br />
Now according to <a href="http://www.petefinnigan.com/weblog/archives/00000973.htm">Pete Finnigan</a> Oracle are meant to be releasing updated versions of the database with security patches applied, but that doesn't seem to be happening on a regular basis (really it should be quarterly to keep up to date with the main product)<br />
So if you're looking for a database for your new open source app. I'd think very carefully before using this one free or not!</p>
