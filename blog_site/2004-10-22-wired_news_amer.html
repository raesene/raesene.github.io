<p>the story over at <a title="Wired News: American Passports to Get Chipped" href="http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,65412,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1">Wired </a> covers the news that american passports are going to get RFID chips...<br />
As is mentioned in the story I don't really understand why they don't just use chips that require contact, thus reducing the risks that the chips is read by unauthorised persons considerably...<br />
Also I can see the sales of passport holders that block RFID signals going through the roof!! (hmm wonder if I could patent that sharpish ;op)</p>
