<p>This advisory on <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a00807cb157.shtml"> Cisco's site </a> could be very nasty.<br />
It appears that there's a vulnerability in IOS that can be exploited by sending crafted packets, and can result in DoS or remote code execution.<br />
If an exploit for this becomes available then expect a lot of problems...</p>
