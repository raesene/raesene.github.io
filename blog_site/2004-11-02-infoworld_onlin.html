<p>There's an article over at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/11/01/HNonlineidtheft_1.html">InfoWorld </a> looking at the various measures that companies have been using to try and mitigate the current rising trend in phishing attacks.<br />
My money's on server-based mitigations as opposed to client-based ones (like the anti-phishing toolbars mentioned in the article).  There are several good reasons for this.<br />
1.  Companies don't and won't control the client environment, so they're not in a good position to dictate the client environment.  Also given the current trend in spyware and virii, there's no way companies can place trust in a client based  solution.<br />
2.  There are literally millions of clients out there which would need to be "fixed" to make a solution work, but for each company there is only one location that needs fixed...<br />
Personally my monies on the deployment of 2-factor authentication like secureID.  Most banks already use it internally, the main reason it hasn't been deployed for customers is cost... well if phishing starts placing a significant cost on the banks, then suddenly it starts being much more viable to deploy....<br />
Of course there are some more complications involved as SecureID can still be vulnerable to a MITM attack, but it would still be a great step forward.....</p>
