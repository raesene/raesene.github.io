<p>Interesting post from Nitesh dhanjani <a href="http://www.dhanjani.com/archives/2007/01/your_gmail_contact_list_is_han.html">here</a> pointing out a problem with Gmail contact lists being available to malicious website owners.<br />
Now this only works if you're logged into gmail, but if you've used it recently and not explicitly logged out... then it'll keep you logged in...<br />
Now google should obviously fix this problem, but I think that there is a wider point here.  Don't leave yourself logged in to websites and be very wary about what you let your browser manage for you security-wise as it's not very security wise (oh I crack myself up ;o)</p>
