<p>There's a review of Network vulnerability assessment tools over at <a title="Network vulnerability assessment management" href="http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2004/110804rev.html?fsrc=rss-security">nwfusion.com</a><br />
I thought it was interesting to see that there are several products in the review based on the nessus engine...<br />
Also one point that intruiged me when I read it was the companies that declined to take part.  Maybe it's just me, but when I read that it tends to make me think "I wonder what was wrong with their product" ie If you think that your product is the best on the market, I would expect that you'd be very keen to see it reviewed and recognised as such....</p>
