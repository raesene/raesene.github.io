<p>Got my <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/">Asus EEE PC</a> delivered today!  It's a nice little mini notebook which runs Linux out of the box and best of all only costs Â£219 !<br />
Initially there's a pretty simplistic interface provided (It's targetted at school kids rather than power users) but there's a great wiki and forum over at <a href="http://www.eeeuser.com/">eee User</a> and it's not too tricky to get shell access and start modifying stuff!!<br />
First off for me has been shutting down the network ports that are listening.  Not sure why they thought everyone would need portmapper and samba server running on their laptops, but to me that's a no brainer to remove straight off !<br />
Then it's off to add the debian repositories to the apt setup on it and before you know it it'll be a great little network security machine :)</p>
