This announcement from Intel and Cisco could be good for wireless networking security, although at the moment it does seem a touch light on detail.  Of course the worry I'd have with this kind of partnership is that the parties might choose to keep their enhancements proprietary, which would not be a good thing...!<br />
I like NAC as an idea, but I've not seen any large deployments of it yet, so I'm unsure as to whether it would be a manageable/scalable solution.</p>
