Interesting article covering passwords and passphrases.  I must say that personally I'm not too fond of trying to remember passphrases (I tend to forget how I punctuated them when I originally set them)...<br />
One of the more interesting ways I've heard of for setting passwords was a friend of mine who uses the second letter each word of song lyrics which he's written himself ;op</p>
