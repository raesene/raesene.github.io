There's what I think is an interesting point in this article about the loss of customer data from Wells Fargo.  The loss didn't occur from Wells Fargo systems, it occured from those of a partner company.<br />
What I find interesting, is that I wonder how many companies can honestly say that they ensure the security of data which they "own" (for want of a better term) no matter where it may reside.<br />
Especially in these days of outsourcing....  It's all very well for companies to spend a lot of money securing their data centres and other obvious places where data lies, but it's really quite pointless if that data (<a href="http://raesene.dnsalias.net/archives/000052.html">or the credential used to access it </a> ) is not as secure when it's processed or stored outside of those data centres.....</p>
