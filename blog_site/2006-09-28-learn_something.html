Every time I work on my app. I feel like I learn something new about every 30 minutes...<br />
this time it was that the :confirm parameter on :link_to (which pops up a confirmation box when you click a link), is an HTML option and thus needs syntax like<br />
 delete, :id =&gt; @item.id}, {:confirm =&gt; 'Are you sure?'} %&gt;</p>
