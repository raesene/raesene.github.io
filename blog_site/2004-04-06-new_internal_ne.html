This article is talking about some new products which are focusing on business/application level analysis of a companies traffic.  I'm a little cynical about this kind of thing, as I would expect that the same kind of "data flood" problem which affects network level IDS systems to affect this kind of solution.<br />
also working at an application level is far harder as it is relatively easy for an automated system to recognise things like HTTP traffic, however an automated system looking at that and saying "thats confidential information from the payroll system" would be very very difficult to set up....</p>
