<p>There's a post over at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hackers/archive/2008/01/31/hellosecureworld-com-launched.aspx"> Microsoft %41%43%45%20%54%65%61%6d blog</a> about their new Hello secure world resource.<br />
When I saw this I thought I'd go over to the site and take a look around, as Microsoft have released some great information about developer security in the past and it's an area of interest for me at the moment..<br />
But then I ran into a complete roadblock getting to the site!  To view it you have to have the latest version of Silverlight installed!  Unfortunately I think that won't work for a lot of users, either due to corporate builds not having deployed silverlight yet (and hopefully decent security policies in place to stop users self-deploying software) or due to platforms issues (admittedly a small proportion of linux fans like myself), although that said it's likely to be an increasing problem for some content, as a lot of mobile devices run Opera which isn't supported by silverlight from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/system-requirements.aspx">what I can see...</a><br />
I understand that Microsoft are keen to get people looking at some of their new technology, but it's a shame that this kind of resource is limited in such a way that a decent proportion of their target audience won't be able to use it....  Perhaps a limited HTML version could be made available so people without access to silverlight</p>
