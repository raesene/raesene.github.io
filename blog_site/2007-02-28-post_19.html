Now I know that Core Impact is a really cool tool, though I've not had a chance to play with it directly, but it's not always the right tool for the job....  Like in this case, we have a network manager who's using this as what looks like a vulnerability management tool and even saying you can give it to a junior engineer to use... D'oh!<br />
Surely the best way as a network manager to do this is through patch management or vuln. scanning tools which you run regularly over your whole estate, not through pointing a Penetration testing tool at some servers...<br />
No matter how many exploits Core have for their product they're never going to find as many holes as a tool that authenticates to the box and enumerates missing patches and security policy non-compliances..<br />
Apart from anything else actually exploiting vulnerable services always runs a risk of crashing the service or indeed the server, which a patch scanning/security config scanning tool wouldn't.<br />
The really bizarre part is that core actually use this as a <a href="http://www.coresecurity.com/?module=ContentMod&amp;action=item&amp;id=32"> case study</a> on their site...</p>
