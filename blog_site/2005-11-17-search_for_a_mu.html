<p>I've been looking for a good music player/jukebox for a while and, hopefully, I've found one which meets all the criteria !<br />
* plays OGG files<br />
* has a jukebox/library feature which reads tags (without crashing!)<br />
* cross-platform, preferably<br />
looks like <a href="http://www.zinf.org/"> zinf</a>'s my man.</p>
