<p>Interesting to see someone have a shot a putting numbers on how far Oracle are behind Microsoft in the database security arena (well secure features as opposed to security features anyway).  The number that they come up with is 5 years...<br />
Assuming that nothing turns up soon it actually looks like SQL Server 2005 will go through it's whole product lifecycle without a published vulnerability.  <a href="http://secunia.com/product/6782/">Secunia</a> are currently showing it affected by 0 vulnerabilities.</p>
