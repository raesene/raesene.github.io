<p>Over at the BBC they're carrying the story that "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3695857.stm"> Teen 'confesses' to Sasser worm</a>".  What worries me most about this, is if this guy turns out to be the author of the Sasser worms and the Netsky virii (which some other newswires are suggesting), he has managed to cause millions of pounds of damage on his own... one teenager.....<br />
Given that, what level of damage could be done by an organised, well funded group of people, looking to maximise the damage done to the Internet...? Not a comforting thought really.</p>
