<p>If you've not already heard about it, the <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/posts"> Scottish Ruby Conference </a> is coming up in March in Edinburgh.  There's a really interesting set of presentations lined up for this years conference, and the hardest thing, I reckon, will be picking between the three tracks!<br />
I've been very lucky to get my talk accepted for this years conference, so I'll be talking about "Breaking things with ruby".  It sits very nicely for me at the corner of two of my main computing interests.  Using ruby and ... well breaking stuff!</p>
