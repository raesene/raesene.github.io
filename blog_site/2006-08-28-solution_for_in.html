One of the problems I'm having with my to do list application is when using the cool AJAX'y in_place_editor field I cant' update an empty field...<br />
Anyway the link above looks like a solution to try.<br />
<b>[Update]</b> Yep that works... initially I didn't seem to be able to get it working but I think that was PEBKAC (need to remember to restart the server to reload the config!)</p>
