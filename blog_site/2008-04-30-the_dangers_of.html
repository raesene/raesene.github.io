<p>I've been reading quite a few posts about Microsofts COFEE toolkit which seems to be designed to help forensics investigators get evidence from (presumably windows based) PCs.<br />
It's amazing to see how many sources on the Internet took the original article <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004379751_msftlaw29.html">here</a> from the Seattle times and came to the conclusion that this was some magical box of tricks that would instantly bypass windows security, as opposed to just being a useful collection of forensics tools, examples of this response are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/385476/microsoft-cofee-wont-perk-you-up-but-it-will-instamagically-hack-your-computer">here</a>, <a href="http://artofinfosec.com/56/hackers-holy-grail-redefined-by-microsoft/">here</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/info/6hj9y/comments/">here</a> and <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/29/1441215"> here</a><br />
Luckily someone at the Seattle Times did some follow-up with Microsoft to confirm that it's actually just a collection of forensics tools and doesn't bypass windows security <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/techtracks/2008/04/looking_for_answers_on_microsofts_cofee_device.html"> here </a></p>
