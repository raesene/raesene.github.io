<p>Over at cryptome.org there's a page - <a title="British Military Intelligence Website Hijacked" href="http://cryptome.org/mi-hijack.htm">British Military Intelligence Website Hijacked</a><br />
Looks like the MOD forgot or didn't want to renew the DNS for intelligencecorps.co.uk!<br />
As a result someone in the US (cryptome say that it's a former british agent, not sure where that info. comes from) has registered the domain, and will be getting e-mails sent by people using the Intelligence Corps part of the mod site... (as well as any other mail that may be sent to that domain!!)<br />
DNS management.. It's important!</p>
