<p>The last piece of the puzzle when it comes to password policies is the account lockout .  Also this is another area where a tighter policy doesn't necessarily lead to improved security.  A lot of companies go for 3 incorrect attempts, and this does lead to a lot of lockouts on Monday mornings and consequently a lot of false positives in the security departments monitoring for attacks on authentication systems.<br />
Again with this section of policy it's important to understand what threat is being mitigated.  Account lockout is designed to mitigate online password guessing attacks.<br />
Now given that if you have a password length of say 8 characters with a requirement for upper and lower case characters you've got a theoretical maximum of 52^8 combinations (reality will be obviously be somewhat less than that).<br />
So realistically the risk of an online password guessing attack succeeding is pretty low, if the attacker doesn't have an insight into likely passwords that a user will choose.<br />
So what's a good number for password lockout.  Well Microsoft <a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/353f7ad9-b53d-41d0-9867-199f6595a01b1033.mspx?mfr=true"> recommends 50</a>, but I've got to say that I think around 10 is good for most circumstances.  My reasoning here is that if someone can't remember their password after 10 goes, they've almost definitely forgotten it.<br />
Of course the next part of this is what to do when you've locked the account out.  Well if you've gone for a reasonably high setting on the incorrect password attempts, then I'd say in most cases lock the account permanently until the user has gone through the password reset procedure (establishing a good password reset procedure is a topic for another day!).<br />
One problem with account lockout that's raised is the potential for Denial-Of-Service.  If the username is predictable to an attacker they can iterate over the namespace and lockout all the accounts.<br />
The mitigation for this depends on the architecture of the systems.  If the system is inside a corporation then monitoring should track the attack and incident response should <i>hopefully</i> be able to track down the attacker.<br />
However for Internet facing systems that's obviously not possible, so some other mitigation may be needed.<br />
Two potential options for this are</p>
<ul>
<li><b>IP based lockout.</b> Instead of locking the account for all users, only lock it for the source IP of the attack.  This isn't perfect protection but may well work for many attackers</li>
<li><b>Use multiple secrets.</b> For example have a password and a secondary secret.  Then only increment the incorrect login count if the attacker is getting the username and one of the secrets correct.  </li>
</ul>
