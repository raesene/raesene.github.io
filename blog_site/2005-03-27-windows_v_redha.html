Some interesting comment about the study comparing Redhat and Windows Server 2003 over at Robert Hensings blog.<br />
As people'll know if they've been following slashdot, it turns out that this study was sponsored by Microsoft .  More information and a link to the report source <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/217538_msftstudy25.html"> here </a><br />
At first glance I like the principles behind the methodology used, ie use a specific server role, rather than a generic install.  I'll hopefully get a chance to read it in more detail, but a couple of things do niggle at me from my first read through.<br />
When they go through the nmap results for the "minimal" linux install, it appears to have ports open that weren't there on the full install! (631/tcp for cups) I find that a bit hard to believe, and even if there is a flaw in the install process, any competant admin will shut down and remove cups as soon as they realise it's running.<br />
Also any competant admin will shut down other services like the rpc ports mentioned (111/tcp and 32768/tcp) and remove the software using them.<br />
Not being too up on my MS stuff at the moment I can't comment whether simple hardening steps would improve it's performance (As far as I can  recall shutting down ports like 445 is nigh-on impossible outside of firewalling the host)<br />
All-in-all it's an interesting study and definately shows that the more modern Microsoft products have a much better stance in relation to security.<br />
[rant] If only their marketing people would allow them to abandon their "you must install irrelevant components and then we'll make it really hard to remove them" stance, they'd be onto a real winner!<br />
why do Microsoft insist that you need an Internet browser on a server! for that point why do you have to install a GUI on a server! it's irrelevant in many cases.  The server will be put in a rack in a datacentre and no-one will physically log onto it again![/ rant]</p>
