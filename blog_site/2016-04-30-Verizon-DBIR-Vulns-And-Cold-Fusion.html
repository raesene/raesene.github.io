<p>So it’s Verizon DBIR time of year again and as with last year there seems to be a little bit of debate around the Top 10 exploited CVEs.  My twitter handle got copied in via some tweets from last year, so I thought I’d take the opportunity of providing a tester’s perspective on this. A more detailed and comprehensive look at this issue is available on the <a href="https://blog.osvdb.org/2016/04/27/a-note-on-the-verizon-dbir-2016-vulnerabilities-claims/">OSVDB Blog</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that sprung out to me from the list was the first two mentioned as top 10 successfully exploited issues on the OSVDB blog.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2015-03-05 – CVE-2015-1637 – Microsoft Windows Secure Channel (Schannel) RSA Temporary Key Handling EXPORT_RSA Ciphers Downgrade MitM (FREAK)</li>
  <li>2015-01-06 – CVE-2015-0204 – OpenSSL RSA Temporary Key Handling EXPORT_RSA Ciphers Downgrade MitM (FREAK)</li>
</ul>

<p>These CVEs related to the <a href="https://freakattack.com/">TLS FREAK attack</a> which is an SSL cipher downgrade issue.  They jumped out at me as I see these on tests quite a bit and frankly, they don’t generally get rated as that serious of an issue.</p>

<p>To draw an analogy if it turns out that these were two of the most successful attacks of 2015, this is kind of like (to me) a scientist saying they’ve perfected <strong>cold fusion</strong>! a) it’s very unlikely and b) if true it’s extremely significant and deserves a lot more prominence than a footnote in the DBIR!</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-unlikely">Why is it unlikely?</h2>

<p>It’s unlikely because to exploit this issues there’s a number of pre-requisites that need to be satisfied.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>MiTM</strong> - This is the big one.  This issue is only exploitable when the attacker can sit in a position to intercept and modify traffic between the client and the server.</li>
  <li><strong>Client + Server Vuln. required</strong> - Unlike some of the other SSL vulnerabilities we’ve seen this requires a vulnerable client and server. Most popular browsers got patched for this pretty quickly (either via auto-update or monthly patch) so the window of attack for most users was pretty small.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptographic Power</strong>.  We’re talking about the ability to mass crack ciphers here.  Now they’re not strong ones (that’s the point of the attack) but still this is some endevour to do at scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Detecting Exploitation</strong>.  To detect exploitation requires that the sensor can tell when the ciphersuite is downgraded,  the attacker cracks the key and then presumably carries out some follow-on attack.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?.</h2>

<p>So lets assume these are indeed two of the most exploited vulnerabilities of 2015, what would that mean?</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a set of attackers who have MiTM positions to attack large numbers of clients and servers on the Internet</li>
  <li>Those attackers have the processing power to mass-crack cryptographic keys gathered from intercepted connections presumably quickly enough to do something with the key in question.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is true that’s a pretty serious problem, as this set of attackers are hardly going to stop what they’re doing once the patch rate for FREAK improves as it did quite rapidly.</p>

<p>Anyway, from the OSVDB blog I understand that Kenna are planning a explanatory blog posting, which I very much look forward to reading.  Things I would really like to see in that would be</p>

<ul>
  <li>Details of how detection successful exploitation of FREAK was achieved.</li>
  <li>Details on what the attack group did with this afterwards.</li>
  <li>Details of what threat group carried out these attacks.</li>
</ul>
