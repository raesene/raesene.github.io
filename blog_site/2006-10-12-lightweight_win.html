Interesting looks like Microsoft are working on a cut down version of vista for certain core services.  This is one of the things that's bugged me about windows for ages (why does a server need a media player!!) and I think one of the main things that'd hampered their activitie s in creating a more secure operating system.<br />
Looks a touch basic at the moment and I'm left wondering how easy it will be for 3rd party vendors to get their software running on it (it would make complete sense for things like database servers to use this rather than a default install of windows), but it's definately a step in the right direction.</p>
