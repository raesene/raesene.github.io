Another interesing piece, on SCADA security, from Bruce Schneier's blog.  It's a good example of unintended consequences.  When SCADA systems were designed it looks like most weren't expected to ever be connected to a general corporate network (let alone the Internet) and as such rarely had the kind of security built in that you would expect from systems controlling critical infrastructure pieces.<br />
There's some interesting commentary on this piece as well and some good links on SCADA security....</p>
