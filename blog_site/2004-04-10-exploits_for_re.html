<p><a title="The Metasploit Project" href="http://www.metasploit.com/projects/Framework/">The Metasploit Project</a> is a collection of exploits with an interface to allow them to be easily executed.<br />
Whilst I can see the value of this kind of project from the point of view of going one step beyond a vulnerability scanner and actually demonstrating an exploit getting, for example, remote root access on a system, the other uses of this kind of work will lower the knowledge barrier for a range of cracking activities....</p>
