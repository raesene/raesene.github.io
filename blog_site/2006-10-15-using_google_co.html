<p>After seeing all the great uses people are finding for Google's new <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch">Code Search</a> I thought, "yeah these are useful, but what would be really useful would be to use this to find out what language is most likely to drive programmers mad!"<br />
So I developed a rigourous methodolgy which primarily consists of searching for code invoking the name of Great Cthulhu !  What surer sign of madness than using the name of a great old one!<br />
so without further ado, here's the results of my painstaking search.<br />

From this we can clearly see that C is leading the pack, with TCL obviously a pretty mind-bending second place.</p>
