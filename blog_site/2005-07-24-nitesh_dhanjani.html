Post about using <a href="http://tor.eff.org/index.html"> ToR </a> to launch attacks (or in this case vulnerability scanners).  Using this it appears that you can be more or less anonymous on the Internet, at a network level anyway.  Only the entry point to the ToR network will know the origin of your traffic.  Of course if you get to the site and put in identifiable information about yourself, that would somewhat defeat the purpose ;op<br />
Of course it would be probably be possible to reconstruct traffic if you could grab the whole ToR network... but unless you're wanted by governmental agencies.. that shouldn't be a problem!<br />
One thing though.  I wonder whether we'll see cases of uninformed courts trying to press charges against the exit points of networks like ToR as they will be what turns up in the logs of destination web servers....</p>
