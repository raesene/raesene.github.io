site on the new CSIA IT Security accreditation for Software products.  What I thought was very handy was that online they've got a list of the claims that the product vendor is making for their product in relation to security *that they are actually willing to have tested*, which implies that they think those claims are justified . Might be useful if you suspected marketing hype from a vendor....<br />
also the sample report I read, the test lab included handy hints about the products usage...</p>
