This is a liitle bit scary... The terrorist watch list has an AFGHANI MAN using an alias of McPhee on it... and they start stopping an AMERICAN WOMAN because her surname is McPhee.....<br />
I actually think I can see why something like this might happen. I reckon that the culture in this environment is one where  everyone is really scared of making a mistake that leads to a successful terrorist attack so they follow instructions to the letter, no matter how stupid..<br />
The only problem is that that approach ignores the opportunity cost and allows people to avoid your checks<br />
- if you spend loads of time with people who are not really suspects, there's less time to look for people who are...<br />
- if you rely on stupid basic measures like surnames, then it's really easy for someone who needs to (and doesn't mind breaking the law), to avoid them...</p>
