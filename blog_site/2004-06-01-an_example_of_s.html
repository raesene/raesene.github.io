Looks from this article like we'll be seeing some patent lawsuits soon in the security world.  This is a good example of what I don't like about software patents, an overly broad patent, for which there may well be prior art, but in order to challenge it there will now have to be an expensive court case out of which no-one will win but the lawyers!!!<br />
