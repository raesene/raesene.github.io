<p>So, we're back from a bit of an unscheduled break for my web server.  The hosting company had a bit of a problem with disks, so my VM has been out of action for a week or so.<br />
Luckily, my backups worked pretty well so minimal content lost.  I'm using the rather unorthodox backup over SMTP, which seems to work pretty well for smaller files.  I knocked up a ruby class called <a href="http://wiki.mccune.org.uk/index.php/Ruby_Backup_Class">Rbackup</a> and just have a script running in cron nightly...<br />
Actually had a trio of hardware failures over the festive period (2 hard disks and a graphics card), which just goes to show that checking backups (and restores!) is very important and not to be put off...</p>
