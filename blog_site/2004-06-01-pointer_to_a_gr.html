Dana has a link from a link on Axel's blog to a great article about Security and economics by Ross Anderson(Gee blogging gets a bit overly linked at times :op)...<br />
As with a lot of Ross Andersons writings it's very thought provoking, with many interesting ideas in it.  A recommended read even if you're not into InfoSec as it provides one possible explanation for things like why Microsoft dominates certain computing markets....<br />
One of the many interesting ideas in it was an analysis of why even the best funded security team can fall foul of a relatively poorly funded attacked in the computing world (starts on Page 4)</p>
