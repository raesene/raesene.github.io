<p>An interesting article over at <a title="vnunet.com US falls hook, line &amp; sinker for phishing" href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1154975">vnunet.com </a> quoting gartner on the levels of loss in the US from phishing scams.  I'm definately suprised that it is as high as $1.2 billion, but if those figures are accurate, I'd hope to see the financial institutions involved moving to authentication schemes which are more resistant to this kind of attack, maybe like the ones I mentioned <a href="http://www.nmrcon.net/archives/000026.html"> here </a></p>
