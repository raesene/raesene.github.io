There's a story over at slashdot covers a presentation from Dan Kaminsky (of <a href="http://www.doxpara.com/read.php/code/paketto.html"> paketto Keiretsu </a> fame) covering some... very interesting ideas about using DNS as a communications channel for arbitrary data (in a similar fashion to things like <a href="http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html">httptunnel</a> ).<br />
Cool stuff this 'cause it drives home the point that it is wrong to think of a network service as just a means of transferring a specific type of data, as many can transfer any type of data you like , it's just usually used for a given type of data.  Which does make the point that traditional security measures like firewalls become a lot less effective as soon as you allow even on protocol across them....<br />
One other thing that occured to me when reading the slides about transmitting ISO images using TXT records, is I wonder what would happen if you caused a caching DNS server to run out of disk space by requesting lots of these records...<br />
I would hope that it would just start purging the records in oldest first order, but I suppose it might DoS some servers...</p>
