<p>Ever gone looking for some insight into your latest rails conundrum and ended up finding answers for the wrong language that mention ruby elsewhere in the page?  I know I have.<br />
Here's an interesting new beta project from google launched today, which allows you to create custom search engines which focus on a given topic area by customising which sites are indexed as part of the search.<br />
I think that this could be really useful for targeted searches as it can cut out a lot of the "spam" and other less relevant sites from the search results.  Also while you can get the same effect by using the site: parameter, doing that about 20 or 30 times per search doesn't really appeal.<br />
So here's a Ruby on rails Search.  At the moment it's based on some sites which I use (list below), but if there are other ones that anyone would like to see include just leave a comment, or volunteer to help out on the search engine front page.<br />
<b>edit:</b> Looks like quite a few people in the RoR community had this idea.... so rather than have lots of different searches doing the same thing I've removed my one.<br />
But if you're looking for a RoR search engine head over here to the <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/search/"> Ruby Inside Search Engine</a></p>
