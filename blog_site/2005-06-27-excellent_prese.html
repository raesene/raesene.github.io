<p>There's a great presentation on Web Application Security Testing tools over at <a href="http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/misc/OWASP_UK_2005_Presentations/AppSec2005-Arian_Evans-AppSec_Assessment_Tools.ppt"> OWASP </a>.  It breaks the available tools down into sensible categories and also has some quite comprehensive lists of available tools for each category.</p>
