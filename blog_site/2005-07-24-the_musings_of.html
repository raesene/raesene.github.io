This is a very interesting post.  "Harry" has done some work looking at the number of deaths from terrorism as opposed to other causes, in the UK and asks some questions about the level of emphasis and spending on those topics.<br />
It's pretty obvious that a lot of this is based on the shock effect and media coverage.  If you take heart disease as an example.. what sort of coverage do the 110,000 people who died in the UK of preventable heart disease, get... compared with the coverage of the London bombings...<br />
Also if you think about it, if the governments goal was preventing the deaths of UK citizens, would they not be better legislating to ban (not just get rid of direct advertising for) unhealthy foods and cigarettes, instead of passing legislation which has a dubious effect, at best, on terrorism....</p>
