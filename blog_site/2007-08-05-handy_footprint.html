<p>Came across a tool that should help make light work of the research phase of a penetration test today. <a href="http://www.paterva.com/web/Evolution/">Paterva Evolution</a>.<br />
Essentially seem to be a nice graphical way of establishing connections related to a specific resource.  So for example, any email addresses that are findable relating to a given domain name.<br />
Of course that kind of research can be done manually, but this is an awful lot slicker!</p>
