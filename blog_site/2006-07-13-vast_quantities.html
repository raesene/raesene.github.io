The vmware virtual appliances directory looks very very cool to me.  It's a collection of pre-installed pre-configured virtual machines setup for specific purposes... need a media-wiki server... no problem... need a network security scannng server ... no problem...<br />
just download and go...<br />
And if you combine it with the release of vmware server FOR FREE then you really have something cool...<br />
One thing I did notice is that, unsurprisingly, all the VM's I looked at are based on Linux, and I expect this kind of thing will really drive the takeup of linux.  If you think about it.. you're asked to demo a say e-mail security server to handle your burgeoning Virus/SPAM problems...<br />
you could pay for a windows server license, buy it, configure it, get some software to do the filtering, install it, configure it, etc etc<br />
or you could download a pre-configured Linux VM using Pre-configured Open source software ...<br />
If you were a small overworked IT department... which would you choose?</p>
