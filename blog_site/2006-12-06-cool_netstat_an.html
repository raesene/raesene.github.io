This post on the sans handlers log has some really useful information about the use of netstat to detect connection information on windows boxes, with some features that I wasn't aware of.<br />
Also put me on to something else that I've been woefully ignorant of . <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/wmic.mspx?mfr=true"> wmic</a><br />
This looks like a really handy command-line tool for getting information out of windows boxes.  from what I can see so far, there's a load of interesting information that you can get from it.  To get started just type <i>"wmic"</i> from a command prompt then type /? for a list of "aliases" that wmic uses for information retrieval.<br />
Some of the commands I've found so far which seem handy "process list brief" and nicconfig list brief" but you can use the <i>/?</i> switch after anything to get some useful help about options...</p>
