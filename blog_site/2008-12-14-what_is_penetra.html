<p>I'm planning to do a series of posts about penetration testing over the next couple of weeks so I thought I should start in the obvious place of defining what it actually is.<br />
You'd think this would be relatively straightforward, but the term "penetration testing" is mis-used all over the place.  Some people use it to refer to vulnerability assessment, some people use it to refer to Web Application Security Assessment, and a lot of business people use it to refer generically to any and all security assessment activity.<br />
So what actually is it?  Well for me, a penetration test is a scenario based assessment where the tester will actually try to exploit security vulnerabilities in a system or systems (depending on the scope) and then leverage those exploited vulnerabilities to gain further access to systems within the scope of the assessment which may be accessible after exploiting the initial vulnerability.<br />
So that's what it is, why is it important to use the term correctly?<br />
Well, different security assessment types have different characteristics and provide the owner of the system with different levels of assurance, so it's important to make sure everyone's talking about the same thing.<br />
For example, vulnerability assessment is typically primarily tool based (eg, Nessus), focuses on networking/Operating System/maybe database level problems and doesn't usually exploit the vulnerabilities found.  Pretty low risk to the systems under test (usually) but won't provide definite confirmation of problems and typically doesn't look at web applications, so it won't cover all the attack surface of a typical web application exposed over the Internet.<br />
So if someone calls a vulnerability assessment a penetration test (and this is pretty common, in my experience) there's a good chance that someone's going to be disappointed in the results...<br />
From the definition I used there's a couple of areas that can be very important to define correctly when conducting a test, so next time, I'm planning to go over some of the common problems and misconceptions in scoping penetration tests.</p>
