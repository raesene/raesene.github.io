Whilst there's limited information available on this attack, what's being mentioned so far is that the attackers used keylogging software to gather passwords etc.<br />
Now this comes onto a pet crusade of mine (I've mentioned it before <a href="http://raesene.dnsalias.net/archives/000052.html"> here </a>).  Companies need to realise that access to all their critical information assets is through client devices, so it's pretty pointless to spend lots of money securing network perimeters and key servers and then leave the client devices which connect to them open to attack!<br />
At the least devices used by people with elevated privileges (eg, sys admins) should get additional protection like host firewalls and IDS, and where possible should be in a physically secure location, as it's very difficult to secure the device once the attacker has physical access to it.</p>
