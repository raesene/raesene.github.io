<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last couple of days you will have noticed a bit of a kerfuffle about a vulnerability in OpenSSL.  One of the more notable parts of this story has been the wide variety of large companies who have been seriously affected by the problem.</p>

<p>This led me to thinking about the fact that a lot of very large profitable corporations are essentially relying on software that they haven’t purchased and which, I doubt, many of them have good security assurance over.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First Question how many billion dollar companies rely on openssl for secure communications?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second question how many of those same companies have sponsored a security review of openssl over the last two years?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now I don’t know the exact answer to either of these questions, but I’m willing to wager that the first is a lot higher than the second.</p>

<p>The real question then becomes, should corporations who rely on open source software be taking an active part in ensuring the security of that software?</p>

<p>Well I’m a security guy so obviously is say yes :-) it seems obvious that if you rely on things you have an interest in the quality of that software…</p>
