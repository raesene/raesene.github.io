An interesting article reporting on Netsec 2004, it focuses on some of the challenges facing web services security.  I definately agree with the point that's made in the article about the problem of how contracts between web services will be negotiated.  Initially when I saw information about UDDI  I thought it looked cool for internal applications, but for external B2B, there needs to be something more, as suppliers will inevitably want to charge for their webservices and customers will inevitably want some guarantees about the service they'll be getting....</p>
