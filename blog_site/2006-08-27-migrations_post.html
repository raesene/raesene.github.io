One of the more useful features of rails is migrations, which remove the requirement to write database specific SQL statement and therefore make moving platforms easy...<br />
anyway the docs are pretty sparse as to what can actually be put in a migration as options, and this post seems to fill in some of the missing blanks...<br />
<b>[update]</b> also there's an article at <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cb08156.html">IBM developerworks</a> which does a reasonable job of introducing the topic.</p>
