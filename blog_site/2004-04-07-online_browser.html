<p>There's a <a title="Browser Security Test" href="http://bcheck.scanit.be/bcheck/sid-54341ffc579090514b8cc815cb1b5493/">Browser Security Test</a> over here that allows you to check you're browser configuration to see if it's vulnerable.<br />
could be handy if you're unsure of whether patches have taken correctly, or if you're looking to demo how insecure unpatched versions of major browsers can be</p>
