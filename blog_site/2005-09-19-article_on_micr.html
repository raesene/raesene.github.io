Interesting article on Microsofts continued moved to improve the security in their new applications...<br />
It's good stuff and I'm very happy to see the quantity of information about software security that Microsoft make available for free on their website...  Hopefully will encourage windows developers in general to take software security more seriously...<br />
Now all Microsoft need to do is allow users to not to have to install millions of lines of unnecessary code on servers (hint think Media player, Internet Explorer etc) and re-write the older legacy code that still seems to cause problems, and they'll be sorted :o)</p>
