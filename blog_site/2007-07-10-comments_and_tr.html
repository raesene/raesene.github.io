<p>I've had to switch comments and trackbacks off on the blog at the moment.  Turns out that my little converted NAS box that I've moved over to is great at static content but not so good a CGIs, so when comment/trackback spammers hit it a lot it overheats!<br />
Going to look into maybe moving the blog to a hosted solution, so hopefully get all back to normal when that happens...<br />
<b>Edit:</b> I've tried something which *may* sort the problem so comments back on for now...</p>
