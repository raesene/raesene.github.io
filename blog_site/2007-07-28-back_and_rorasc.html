<p>Well I'm back from (sometimes) sunny shetland.  Thanks to some rain and a laptop I'd taken I got some work done on a tool I've started developing for my SANS GSOC gold paper.<br />
<a href="http://rorascanner.rubyforge.org">RoraScanner</a> is a Oracle 10G security scanner written in ruby.  I'm enjoying writing it at the moment as it's let me develop my ruby skills and my oracle skills at the same time.<br />
Hopefully it'll also become a reasonably useful security scanner!</p>
