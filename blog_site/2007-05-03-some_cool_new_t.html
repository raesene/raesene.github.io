<p>I've been having some fun sorting out some cool new tech. for my house.  I've been looking for something to replace the large tower box I've got running my file/print &amp; website for a while. Mainly so I can separate them and not be hosting any extneral services on the same machine as I'm hosting internal services.<br />
So I've been looking for small, quiet, cheap Linux boxes to use for a webserver and I came across the <a href="http://www.buffalo-technology.com/products/network-storage/linkstation/linkstation-pro/">Buffalo Linkstation Pro</a>.  It only costs 99 pounds in the UK and is designed as a NAS device, however in common with most of these kinds of devices, it's really a small ARM-based computer running Linux.  So following a quick trip to the excellent <a href="http://84.16.234.138//index.php?title=Main_Page"> Linkstation wiki</a> some downloading and following of instructions to re-flash the device, I've now got a debian Linux server with 128MB RAM and a 250GB hard drive all for under a hundred quid!!<br />
The other thing I set-up for the first time the other night was <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">tor</a>, mainly to see how easy or difficult it would be.  the answer is (on Fedora Core 6 at least) pretty easy, two package installs and a couple of edits to config files and I'm surfing anonymously.  It's a bit slow but apart from that seems to do what it says on the tin.  Very handy to test source IP address restrictions if you're using them.</p>
