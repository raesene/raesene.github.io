<p><a> true anymore" href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/04/28/associations-arent-dependent-true-anymore/"&gt;Riding Rails: Associations aren't :dependent =&gt; true anymore</a><br />
Some useful info. about how :dependent works in rails 1.1+ . Handy if you've got items that are dependent on one another and want to get rid of the child objects when you delete the parent.<br />
the other part of this post is a continuation of something I touched on before.  Ruby on Rails is great but it really moves too fast for print books.  This is a good example.<br />
In my copy of Ruby on Rails: Up and running, the bit on cascading relationships says that you specify :dependent =&gt; :true , however that doesn't work (as I found out when I tried it), cue 10 minutes of searching around for the answer which led to the post above.<br />
Now this is probably the most recent book published about RoR and I only got my copy about 3 weeks ago, but I've found more than a couple of areas which don't match up with my rails deployment and I'm not even using Edge rails!</p>
