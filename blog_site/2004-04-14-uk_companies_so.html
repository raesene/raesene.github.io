This is one of the stories that always emerge when the large consultancy companies do their annual security surveys.  In amongst alot of stats there are some meaningful pieces of information.  This story focuses on the state of wireless security (poor).<br />
I'm not at all suprised that 50+% of companies haven't deployed security on their wireless LANS, however it is very worrying as they are essentially allowing the man on the street (literrally) to wander into their corporate LAN without any restriction.<br />
Given that most companies practice the "warm smarty" method of network security (crunchy on the outside, soft and squishy on the inside), this is especially worrying.</p>
