Interesting looking list of SQL injection scanners although Justin notes <a href="http://www.justinclarke.com/archives/2007/05/sqlbrute_makes.html">here </a> that at least one of them, sqlbrute, isn't really a scanner.<br />
Anyway I'm planning to run some tests on them to see how they handle some basic SQL injection flaws, so it'll be interesting to see how they go.</p>
