<p>I found an interesting product called<a title="GroundWork - Monitor - Monitor network availability and performance" href="http://itgroundwork.com/products/monitor.html"> GroundWork</a>.<br />
However what was more interesting to me was the advert's they're using to attract customer, which are actively promoting the products open source background<br />
"no proprietary hassles" and "open source flexibility" are 2 of the phrases from the ads.<br />
I'd be interested to know how that approach works out for them, 'cause it's fairly opposed to what a lot of the research firms seem to say about open source, which is that big business finds the open source nature of the software a turn off...</p>
