<p>Found a cople of links which give lots of useful information on windows processes like the detail of what each does. links <a title="Windows Process Library" href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/">here</a> and <a href="http://answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm"> here </a>.<br />
Of course you should always be cautious about assuming that just 'cause a process has a given name that it will do what is contained in lists like this, as it isn't too hard to create a binary with any given name, however useful info. all the same.</p>
