Some interesting numbers relating to security trends. It's not surprising really though it should be..<br />
over half of companies admit they're not doing a good job of working out what's on the network (kinda' hard to patch a box you don't know you've got)<br />
And probably the worst, over 25% of companies dedicate no resource to assessing the value of business assets.<br />
the question is how are these companies doing risk assessments or Business Continuity Planning  (with the cynical answer being..."Not Well")...</p>
