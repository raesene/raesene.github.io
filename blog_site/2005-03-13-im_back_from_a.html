<p>well the blog's been offline for about 2 months, not really to plan....<br />
Caused by a series of hardware failures in the old server, 1st the motherboard/processor and then the system disk, 2 days later!<br />
Combined with a 3 week holiday in India, left me sans server for quite a while...<br />
But I'm back up and running now better than ever, the servers gone from a PII-450 to a Athlon64 2800+ which should make things a bit nippier.....</p>
